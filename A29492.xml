            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a Mighty Veneration the firſt and better Ages had for their Governours, The Guides of their Souls, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Rules of Chriſtianity, and even to the common ſenſe of Mankind; And that quite contrary now-a-dayes, the Holy Orders are vilely eſteemed by
<pb facs="tcp:104488:3"/>Abundance of Men, (and thoſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pretending a High Zeal for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,) is to be imputed very much to their bad Education in their tender years, and perhaps to no one thing more.</p>
            <p>But it is not againſt this Evil alone, that a good Education of our Youth would provide an effectual Remedy, but in my opinion, againſt a Multitude of Epidemical Errors and Immoralities. It is certain, True Religion thrives beſt when planted betimes, having its Foundation in an early Piety. Happy are thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren whoſe Lot is to be begotten of Godly Parents, careful to ſeaſon their Minds with vertuous and ſober Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and while they are Children, to acquaint them with the Scriptures of Truth and Godlineſs None ſtart with greater Advantages in the Chriſtian Race, nor uſually perſevere with a more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Conſtancy therein, then they who are taught to remember their Creator in the Days of their Youth, the firſt Fruits of their Time being Conſecrated to God and Religion, before corrupt affections have
<pb facs="tcp:104488:3"/>clapt a Bias upon their Inclinations, and a Train of Vices hath depraved, and in great meaſure laid a ſleep the Natural No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Good and Evil in them.</p>
            <p>To this great purpoſe Catechizing and Diligence in teaching the Catechiſm is continually and very appoſitely urged upon Us of the Parochial Clergy, by our Ordinaries in their Annual Viſitations, according to the Royal Injunctions. And loth I am to ſay, or even to think any of my Brethren ſo culpable, as either to be ſo ignorant as to need my Inſtructions, or ſo negligent as to want my Excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſo neceſſary and (as is Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally acknowledged) ſo profitable an Office of their Miniſtration.</p>
            <p>It is for the common People's ſake therefore, that I expoſe theſe Specimens of my Labours in this kind to a publick View. I think it a great Bleſſing to them, that they may have the Advantage of being taught by both their ſenſes, their Eyes as well as their Ears. What is taught by the Ear may affect and pierce more, but the Letter written endureth
<pb facs="tcp:104488:4"/>longer, and the Souls of men have the Advantage of a more deliberate Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and a longer continuance therein.</p>
            <p>Having therefore a Deſire to do good both ways, according to my poor Abilities, (not ſo much fearing Cenſures, as endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to Edifie,) I ſubmiſſively offer theſe my Labours to your Graces Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, as juſtly yours, being performed in your Charge, by one under your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Juriſdiction, who unfeignedly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the Peace and Proſperity of Gods Holy Catholick Church, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual dew of his Heavenly Bleſſing upon the Biſhops and Clergy thereof, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly a double Portion of his Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Grace; that we may be long hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in your Wiſe and Active Conduct; and one who earneſtly begging your Graces Prayers for him, heartily deſires to approve himſelf upon all Occaſions.</p>

               <salute>Reverend Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHAT Place and Figure the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſt had in the Primitive Churches is well known: and the Diligent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this part of our Miniſtry, being moſt ſtrictly required by the Canons of that Holy Church, whereunto by all manner of right we ow the moſt ſincere Obedience; which being alſo ſo frequently urged upon our practice by our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries at every Viſitation, and there being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, nothing we do, or can do, that can be more beneficial to our Flocks; Nothing which (if rightly performed) can more conduce to a thorough Reformation of Chriſtians, or to the comfort and Satisfaction of the Paſtors Conſciences, It ſeems
<pb facs="tcp:104488:5"/>ſtrange to me, That it is ſo much neglected, at leaſt moſt curſorily and inſipidly performed in many Pariſhes, eſpecially in Market Towns, where nothing pleaſeth, but the Miniſter's ſett and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Diſcourſes on ſome particular Texts in Scripture, commonly called Preaching, as if there were no other preaching but this.</p>
            <p>God forbid I ſhould paſs the leaſt undecent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon thoſe; but this I am bold to ſay, Whatever good Man will take the pains (as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ought) to examine his Children and Servants of what they have learnt by them, and to aſſiſt them to his utmoſt power to profit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; He will ſoon find it a very ſlender Account they are able to give of an hours Diſcourſe, and muſt, from a conſtant Experience hereof, conclude an abſolute Neceſſity of both Miniſters and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Families greateſt Diligence in this eaſie and Familiar way of inſtructing them in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and that it is very little good, which Sermonizing without Catechizing can do, and therefore hath not the leaſt appearance of juſtice for thruſting it out of the Church.</p>
            <p>That we ought to Catechize, I hope I need not ſay much to convince any thinking Man; the ſtreſs lies in finding out ſuch a courſe as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it may be done to purpoſe, that if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, We may ſave ourſelves, and them that hear us, even the moſt ignorant of them that are willing to learn. And I would gladly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of your charitable conſtruction of this my
<pb facs="tcp:104488:5"/>publiſhing my own Method, ſo as by no means to interpret it a ſelf-conceited or preſumptuous preſcribing it to others. Give me leave only to ſhew you how I fell into it, and then be it at your own Diſcretion how far you will accept or reject it, imitate, alter, or wholly decline it.</p>
            <p>I account it to my ſelf a great Bleſſing, that being by a ſickly Conſtitution of Body forced from the Breaſts of my Mother, that Famous School of the Prophets, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> a very good Providence caſt me under the Wings and Guidance of an aged Divine, Grave, Learned and pious, a truly Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, and ſufferer for his Sovereign, a moſt Orthodox Son of the Church.</p>
            <p>From him I had this Advice in my ſtudies, (and it would be Envy to others Good to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it) to fix my Theological Studies in the firſt place upon the Creed, The Lords Prayer, and the Decalogue, with this reaſon to perſwade it, That by compoſing Sermons on theſe, I ſhould be at once provided with whatever ſhould be uſeful in a Congregation in the Afternoons, and be likewiſe thereby enabled for this great work of Catechizing profitably, by but extracting the Quinteſſence of ſuch Compoſures by way of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and Anſwers as I went along; and alſo laſtly have a conſtant ſtorehouſe to repair to, ſerviceable upon all Occaſions, and upon all ſorts of Subjects.</p>
            <p>I heartily thank God, that I had this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb facs="tcp:104488:6"/>given me, and that I followed it. Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing one way or other, either by a continued plain and homely diſcourſe, or by teaching Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and Anſwers, and then uſing theſe ſhort Deſcants upon them, hath been my conſtant courſe in that place whither Divine Providence caſt me. In taking which, having found it all along a great drudgery to Tranſcribe, I was forc'd when I had gone thorough the Catechiſm, to be at the charge of an Impreſſion of ſo many Copies as might ſerve my Pariſh, which proving very faulty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, to my great diſſatisfaction, I thought it not amiſs to make a new Edition thereof; and to make it more profitable to all that would make any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe thereof, I have added the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſt's Enlargement upon each Queſtion and Anſwer throughout the whole.</p>
            <p>For the Queſtions and Anſwers upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creed, I acknowledge ſome conſiderable part of them, and the moſt material, upon which the reſt are grounded, to be thoſe Compoſures of the aforeſaid excellent Perſon, and them he gave to the Youth in his Pariſh to learn, and conſtantly examined them therein, to their great profit and Edification. And now I beg it may not be thought either preſumption or vain glory in me, to add thereto as I ſaw cauſe, to make it as eaſie as I could, to the weakeſt Capacities.</p>
            <p>—I have well weighed every word in the Creed, and every clauſe, and almoſt every word in the whole Church-Catechiſm, from the beginning
<pb facs="tcp:104488:6"/>to the end, proving every Obſervation therein by very plain Scriptures; which Courſe and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, as it ſets the moſt Notable Texts before the younger peoples Eyes, and may to their great profit ſerve to imprint them in their Memories; ſo doth it mightily conduce to ſettle and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them in a firm belief of ſound Doctrine. And if Parents and Maſters of Families would be perſwaded thus to exerciſe their Youth, I am morally certain, it would make them good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Good Proteſtants, (or which is, I think, the ſame thing) Good and firm Members of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For as here, They may be inſtructed in the Truth and Certainty of the Chriſtian Religion in Oppoſition to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> ſo are all juſt Occaſions taken to arm them againſt Fanaticiſm and Separation. And if ſuch ſound Principles of Faith and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience be timely inſtilled into tender Minds; If Men would thus teach and bring up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord, it will be very hard to think how they can fail of a competent underſtanding of their Religion, and whatever is neceſſary to be known or believed to their Salvation, or turn Apoſtates from it, without an extreme Oſcitancy and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs in remembring and conſidering what they have been taught, or an incurable, wanton itch after Novelties; which latter, if indulged, it may be expected they will through Gods juſt
<pb facs="tcp:104488:7"/>judgment fall into damnable Errors, and all the innumerable ſnares of the Devil, which he ſhall think fit to lay for them; and being once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildred in them, it is rare, and in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing very difficult for any to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves, being taken Captive by him at his Will.</p>

Where we read of the Prophets calling for faithful Witneſſes, when he called the Propheteſſes Son, <hi>Maher, Shalal, Haſhbaz,</hi> and in <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.59. we read that <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Neighbours and Couſins came together the Eight day to Circumciſe her child, and would have called him after the name of his Father, <hi>Zecharias.</hi> So that by this account the Uſe of Godfathers and Godmothers ſeems to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived (like the many other Uſages in Chriſtianity) from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. But whether ſo or no, it is manifeſt it was always practiced in the Chriſtian Church. And that for thoſe great ends of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Religion and preſerving them from falling from it, who was already initiated into it. For if parents, natural parents, proved ignorant and could not; or wicked and would not teach and Educate their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren aright, or if they chanced to die or to turn A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates, Hereby the Church took care for the godly Education of their Children. And this (ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

True (will ſome ſay) this was no more than what was Neceſſary in thoſe Times of Perſecution, but not ſo now, in theſe times of the Churches Peace. Yes, I anſwer, it is yet as neceſſary as then, Becauſe We know not how ſoon Perſecutions may come, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the preſent Age we live in abounds with many damnable Errours and Hereſies, and the Prophaneſs and Debauchery thereof is very great, and therefore it is as needful now as ever, That ſome Perſons be engaged publickly to ſee that children that are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized

                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> It is indeed a very ſad thing that Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Godmothers ſo generally neglect their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; I ſay therefore, O that All perſons would be ſerious in undertaking this charge, and fulfill it more Conſcientiouſly than commonly men do! And then, The Benefit of this Cuſtom would convince all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, how convenient it is that it be retained, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any perſons making Shipwrack of Faith and of a good Conſcience when they come to years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why do Chriſtians give their Children names in Baptiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> gave names to their children in Circumciſion, and Baptiſm ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the room of it; Again, it is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed That their names ſhould always put them in mind of their Chriſtianity, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived together with their names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Firſt, That Baptiſm ſucceeds in the room of Circumciſion, As it is clear in matter of Fact, ſo I take it to be manifeſt in that one Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Coloſſ. 1.11. <hi>In whom alſo ye are Circumciſed by the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion made without Hands in putting off the Body of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104488:9"/>Sins of the fleſh, by the Circumciſion of Chriſt, buried with him in Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Jews</hi> gave their names, when they Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed their Children is plain in divers inſtances. To name but two, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.3, 4. Abraham <hi>called the name of his Son, which</hi> Sarah <hi>bare unto him,</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>circumciſed his ſon</hi> Iſaac <hi>being Eight days old, as God commanded him.</hi> And ſo had <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt his name gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Him at his circumciſion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.59. and ſo had our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.21. <hi>When</hi> 8 <hi>days were accompliſhed for the circumciſing of the child, his name was called Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, which was ſo named of the Angel, before he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Womb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3.

                  <hi>A.</hi> The ſame which God made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> after his fall in thoſe words, <hi>(The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head)</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> This Covenant as made with <hi>Adam</hi> as the common parent and Repreſentative of all mankind, you have in <hi>Gen</hi> 3.15. and as it was renewed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> you have <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. and 22.18. <hi>In thee, in thy Seed, (i. e.</hi> in Chriſt as St. <hi>Paul</hi> explains it <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8.) <hi>ſhall all Families of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> Which Covenant was afterwards renewed or new revealed in other words to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah till Shilo come;</hi> by <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 18.15. <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord God raiſe up unto you of your Brethren like unto me, him ſhall ye hear;</hi> by <hi>David,</hi> by <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremy</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets, too many to recite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly here, and ſtill in every age it was more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed then the former until the Seed came, the Mediator of this covenant, and ratified and eſtabliſhed it by his Blood.</p>
               <p>It will be of great Uſe to you (Good Children) if you can reach to underſtand thus much, much more if you can attain a competent practical knowledge of the terms of this Covenant, as your Catechiſm (well underſtood) may inſtruct you. I ask you therefore</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How many parts are there in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant?</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>What then is Gods part, or what doth God promiſe in the Covenant of Grace?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It ſhews what Benefits we receive by Baptiſm, to wit, that of limbs of Satan, we are therein made members of Chriſt: Of Children of Wrath and of the Devil, we are therein made Children of God; and of heirs of Hell, we become inheritors of the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Theſe are great things (Good Children) for you to learn, and having learnt them, I beſeech you, do your beſt to conſider them, and ſee how all are grounded in the plain words of Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>Of Limbs of Satan, as the Head and Father of all wicked ones, we are by Baptiſme made members of Chriſt. Members (you all know) relate to a Body, Now the Church is the Body whereof Chriſt is the Head: and by Baptiſm we are made members of the Church which is the Myſtical Body of Chriſt. For Baptiſm is the Sacrament of Admiſſion into the Church, as the Lords Supper is the Sacrament of nouriſhment in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>By one ſpirit we are all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into one body, whether Jew or Gentile.</hi>

Gal. 3.26, 27. <hi>Ye are all the children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus; For as many of you as have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104488:11"/>been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> And from hence they may call God, Father, ſaying, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven,</hi> witneſs what Chriſt ſaid to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>John</hi> 20.17. <hi>I aſcend to my Father and your Father,</hi> and from hence they are brethren to Chriſt, for <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. <hi>He is not aſhamed to call them Brethren.</hi> And being thus children and ſons of God, they are 3.

All which is made good by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral great Texts, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>He hath begotten us again to a lively hope, even of an inheritance incorruptible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled and which fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for us.</hi> Tit. 3.5, 7. <hi>According to his mercy he ſaved us by the Laver and waſhing of Regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt; That being juſtified by his Grace we ſhould be made heirs of eternal Life.</hi> Rom. 8.16, 17. <hi>The Spirit beareth witneſs, that we are the children of God; and if children then heirs: Heirs with God, joynt heirs with Chriſt: if we ſuffer with him we ſhall alſo reign with him.</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> The old Covenant of Works did not promiſe Forgiveneſs of Sins, nor accepted of Repentance, but required perfect Unſinning Obedience: But this new Covenant of Grace, doth promiſe forgiveneſs of ſins upon repentance, and only requires ſincere Obedience.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> They only promiſe them in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens names, till they be of age to take it upon themſelves; ſo the duty promiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Children, and Godfathers and Godmothers engage only to ſee they be taught what they promiſed for them, and to excite them to perform it by inſtructions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, exhortations and prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> The ſcope of this Anſwer is to ſtate the matter, how far Sureties ſtand engaged by what is done at Baptiſm. But to this are children chiefly to take heed, that the things promiſed do chiefly lye on them to perform, though not themſelves, but others engaged it only in their names. For they are in equity bound thereby. For Parents uſually oblige their Children in civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and Bargains, and why not much more then, to what is their Bounden duty before, as Creatures to their Lord, their Maker and Redeemer? Or who will ſay but that it is in the Parents power to devote their Children to Gods ſpecial ſervice, as <hi>Hannah</hi> did <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. or as <hi>Timothy</hi>'s parents may well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have done Him, in that they taught Him the Scriptures of a child; and without doubt, whatſoever children they be that renounce or do not perform this their Baptiſmal Vow, though but made by others, in their name, they incur the Guilt of Perjuty, and forfeit all the promiſes of God made to them in his Covenant.</p>
               <p>To prevent this therefore, and to make children (when

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes verily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Mark here (good child) what thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeſt, even to ſtand to the vow made in thy name, and remember the Text, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Better never vow, than not perform what thou haſt vowed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How ſhalt thou ever be able to do thoſe things, being by nature ſo prone to all evil, and averſe to all Good?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I ſhall be able to do them through Chriſt ſtrengthning me, therefore I ſay, (and by Gods help ſo I will.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Thus is every child taught modeſtly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Reſolution in the words of St. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 4.13. and it much concerns you and all men to be humbly ſenſible of what the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>In me, that is, in my fleſh dwelleth no good thing.</hi> And that our Saviour ſaith expreſly, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</hi> And becauſe this help ſhall not be wanting to any that will ſincerely endeavour it, therefore doth the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. hereby enforce his exhortation, <hi>work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in you both to will and do of his good
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104488:17"/>pleaſure.</hi> As if he had ſaid, take heed to yourſelves that you make uſe of Gods help, while you may have it, work yourſelves, while God worketh with, and in you.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What art thou better for being baptized, more than thoſe that never were baptized?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This being Gods own Ordinance for waſhing away Original ſin, and admitting men into Covenant with God: I am thereby called into a ſtate of Salvation through Chriſt, for which therefore I heartily thank God my heavenly father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> By this Anſwer a child is well taught to be deeply ſenſible, and to declare himſelf to be ſo, that he is in a much better Condition then he was before, or than they are who never were Baptized. For who can deny that Baptiſm is Chriſts own ordinance for waſhing away ſin, and admitting him into Covenant with God? And what is this but a ſtate of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt? there being as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. <hi>No ſalvation to be had by any other, no other name given under heaven whereby we muſt be ſaved, but only the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For this therefore their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought thus into a ſtate of Salvation, Holy Church very laudably teaches her children to give pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick thanks, according to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings God hath ordained praiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q <hi>But what if you ſhould fall off from, or renounce your Baptiſm as many do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Then ſhall I be much worſe for being Baptized. This Apoſtacy will aggravate my Damnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> True: for as <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.21. <hi>He only that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104488:17"/>to the end ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.40. <hi>Wo unto them whoſe latter end is worſe than their beginning,</hi> who, (as the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.30. expreſſeth <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi>) <hi>draw back to the perdition of their Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What means muſt you then uſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I will pray continually that God will give me his Grace, that I may continue in the ſame unto my lives end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> And I beſeech and exhort you, Good Children, learn thus to pray betimes, and exerciſe your ſelves in prayer daily, in ſome or other good forms of prayer for this great thing that you may continue in Chriſts words, and ſo be his Diſciples indeed, <hi>John</hi> 8.29. Ask, and ſeek, and knock, as your Saviour teacheth you, by prayer, by continual prayer, and he aſſures you then of the help of his Holy Spirit to enable you to keep your Baptiſmal Vow, that having entred into the way of life you ſhall never forſake it, and of this he aſſures you by an excellent ſimilitude which you cannot chuſe but underſtand, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. <hi>If your natural parents be ready to give you bread, and clothing, and all good things you ſtand in need of, upon your begging them, How much more will your Heavenly Father give his Holy Spirit to them that ask it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the General Heads of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Creed, the Decalogue, the Lords prayer, and the Doctrine of the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> I would beſpeak you in St. <hi>Peters</hi> words, you and the whole Congregation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2, 13. <hi>I ſay unto you I will not be negligent to put you always in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of theſe things, although I may hope many of you know them already and are eſtabliſhed in the Truth.</hi> For
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104488:18"/>even they that know them already, have yet great need to be put continually in remembrance of them, and therefore I think it not only meet, but alſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to ſtir you up by putting you in remembrance of them, as long as I am in this Tabernacle, as long as I live, that you may be always thinking of them, and never forget them. <hi>Credenda, Agenda, Oranda,</hi> What you muſt believe, what you muſt do and practice, and what you muſt pray for, and Gods Covenant and Promiſes ſealed to you in the Sacraments, theſe are the great things in Chriſtian Doctrine, neceſſary to be known, that you may be ſaved, and upon theſe four General Heads depend all the Queſtions in your Catechiſm.</p>
               <p>Either by way of Introduction, ſhewing you when, by whoſe means, upon what terms and conditions you became Chriſtians, together with the great Benefits that belong to you as Chriſtians, if your converſations be ſuch as becomes the Goſpel, and the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and thoſe things you have had and I hope have learnt in our Explanation of the four firſt Queſtions and their Anſwers: or elſe they ſerve to Connect and joyn together the great Doctrines taught you in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm in an orderly Method for the help of your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, or to help you to a clear and full under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them. To come then to the main points to be learnt by Catechiſm, I ask you in the firſt place</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why is the Creed the firſt part of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Becauſe to believe aright is the very ground work of all Religion: and then muſt I ſhew my believing heartily by my good works of Obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Yea, ſo it is certainly, A right belief is the Foundation of Religion. Thereforewhen the Jaylor asked <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Act.</hi> 16.31. <hi>Sirs, what ſhall I do
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104488:18"/>to be ſaved?</hi> To this they directed him in the firſt place, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, thou and thine houſe.</hi> But then, it is a leſſon I would take all occaſions to teach you, That there is no reſting in a dead Faith without good works of Obedience. And for this time I only offer to you for proof hereof, the tenour of our Saviours Commiſſion to his Apoſtles, when he ſent them forth to convert the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. He bad them, whomſoever they ſhould by Baptiſm admit into the Church and the Confeſſion of Chriſtianity, <hi>to teach them to obſerve all things whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he had commanded them.</hi> And you have an eminent inſtance of the neceſſary Conjunction of Obedience with Faith in that grand Doctrine of Chriſtianity, that of the Trinity, into which we are expreſly Baptized, as the next Queſtions and their Anſwers inſtruct you.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Which is the great Fundamental in the Faith of Chriſtians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Doctrine of the Trinity, that is, to believe in God the Father as Creator, in God the Son as Redeemer, and in God the Holy Ghoſt as Sanctifier; This is the Grand Myſtery in Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> In my mind your Church-Catechiſm pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds this Doctrine with a very becoming Gravity, and no man can deny this Doctrine ſo propounded, but he muſt withall deny and reject plain Scripture.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>In the firſt place then, Rehearſe the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of thy Beliefe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I Believe in God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What doſt thou chiefly learn in theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of thy Belief?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt I learn to believe in God the F. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:104488:19"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Whoſoever will own himſelf a Chriſtian, He muſt profeſs his Chriſtian Faith in this tenor. To believe in God firſt as Creator, who made me and all the world, according to that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. <hi>To us there is but one God the Father of all things, and we in him, and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt by whom are all things, and we by him.</hi> (2) In God the Son our L. Jeſus Chriſt as Redeemer, who redeemed me and all Mankind. For 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5, 6. <hi>There is one God and one Mediator between God and man, The man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſome for all to be teſtified in due time.</hi> (3) In God the Holy Ghoſt as Sanctifier, who Sanctifieth me and all the elect people of God. For 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Whoſoeve are choſen to Salvation it is through Sanctification of the ſpirit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now you are taught in your Anſwer to my next Queſtion, what an influence this Doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath to good life and obedience, if it be believed aright, and I ſhall have occaſion hereafter to prove e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular in it by the Scriptures. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent therefore I ſhall content my ſelf with hearing you rehearſe it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>In what manner muſt we believe in theſe perſons?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> So as to pay each perſon his reſpective Duty: for example, to love, fear and ſerve God the Father, as my great Creator and moſt Gracious preſerver; To truſt in God the Son and obey his Goſpel, as my only Lord and Saviour; and to follow the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and directions of God the Holy Ghoſt, and to make Uſe of his Grace and Aſſiſtance, as my Guide and Sanctifier and Comforter.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:104488:19"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> That you may well underſtand your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief as a Chriſtian, and particularly what you profeſs to believe of each perſon in the Bleſſed Trinity, and every word in it, I ask you in the firſt place.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why do you ſay, I Believe, rather than we, or they believe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe, Though the prayers of others may avail much, yet every man muſt be ſaved by his own Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> And Think not ſleightly of this leſſon, for it levels directly againſt the Papiſts implicite Faith. We are often taught to pray for one another, ſaying, Our Father which art in Heaven, Give us, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, chap. 5.6. <hi>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much, i. e.</hi> for others as well as for himſelf, for of ſuch prayer he there ſpeaks. But no man can believe for any but himſelf, <hi>Habak.</hi> 2.4. <hi>By his Faith ſhall the juſt live. i.e.</hi> lead his life here according to Gods will revealed in his word, and ſo be ſaved at laſt for ever. So is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one therefore by his Creed taught to ſay, not we believe, for others, but I Believe, for himſelf, as the man in the Goſpel whoſe Son was dumb, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.17, 23. <hi>Lord I believe, Lord, help mine unbelief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>In whom doſt thou believe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In God only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Believing in, is more then bare believing, for beſides Credence or Aſſent, it implies Truſt and Affiance, and is a Divine Honour proper to God only, and therefore we ſay in the Creed, I believe in God, we do not ſay alike, I believe in the Holy Gatholick Church, but I believe the Holy Catholick Church. For <hi>Curſed is the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord,</hi> Jer. 17.5.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104488:20"/>And therefore Chriſt avoucheth himſelf to be God, when he ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 14.1. <hi>Ye believe in God, believe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is it to believe in God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To believe there is a God, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that what God ſaith, is undoubtedly true, and to depend upon him, in Hope, for the accompliſhment of his promiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> The Firſt Principle in Religion (againſt Atheiſts) is that there is a God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>He that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> And the next Principle is the certainty of his Word, <hi>That it is as Gold tryed ſeven times in the fire,</hi> Pſal. 12.6. For <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. <hi>He is not as man, that he ſhould lie.</hi> Luk. 16.17. <hi>It is eaſier for heaven and earth to paſs, than one jot or tittle of his Word to fail.</hi> And then from theſe we infer the ſafety of truſting in him, for the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his promiſes. For <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.23. <hi>Faithful is he that hath promiſed, who alſo will perform.</hi> We may therefore take up the Prophet <hi>Micahs</hi> words, chap. 4.5. <hi>All peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple walk every one in the name of his God, But we will walk in the name of the Lord our God, for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How many Gods are there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> One God only, therefore I profeſs to believe in God Singularly, and not in Gods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> You know what the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. <hi>The Heathens have Gods many, and Lords many, but we know they are all but Idels,</hi> and an Idol is nothing, and therefore to us Chriſtians, There is no other God but One, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.6. <hi>One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is this One God diſtinguiſhed?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:104488:20"/>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Theſe three Perſons in the Godhead were apparently diſtinguiſhed in Chriſts Baptiſm at the river <hi>Jordan.</hi> For the Father ſpake from heaven, ſaying, This is my Beloved Son, and the H. Ghoſt deſcended upon him like a Dove. And ſo are they manifeſtly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in our Baptiſm. For we are expreſly Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt. And S. <hi>John</hi> 1 Ep. 5.7. affirms both the diſtinction of the perſons, and their Unity of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſaying, <hi>There be three that bear record in Heaven, The Father, the Word, and the ſpirit, and theſe three are one.</hi> More I need not to ſay of this great Myſterious Doctrine at this time, whoſo would better underſtand it, let him ſtudy the Creed of S. <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> Let us now ſee what the Apoſtles Creed teacheth us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve of each perſon in this Bleſſed Trinity.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What doſt thou believe of the Firſt perſon?</hi>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104488:21"/>
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.10. <hi>He is the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableneſs nor ſhaddow of turning.</hi> Heb. 13.8. <hi>He is the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence, for <hi>Am I a God at hand</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and not a God afar of?</hi> Jer. 23.24. <hi>Can any hide himſelf in ſecret places, that I ſhould not ſee him?</hi> ſaith the Lord. <hi>Do not I fill heaven and earth?</hi> ſaith the Lord. And of this Attribute and perfection, the ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael</hi> thus deſcants, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7, 8, 9. <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit? and whither ſhall I flee from thy preſence? If I go up unto heaven, Thou art there: If I make my bed in hell, thou art there alſo, If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermoſt parts of the ſea, even there ſhall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand ſhall hold me.</hi> And he there teaches us this leſſon, that all, both young and old, have this always in their minds, to reſtrain them from every ſinful thing, even when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and in ſecret places, and no eye ſees them, That yet God always ſees them, ver. 12. <hi>Even the darkneſs hides not from thee, but the night is as clear as the day: darkneſs and light are both alike to thee.</hi> And therefore whenever we are tempted to ſin, and whatſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of ſecrecy we may have for it, we ſhould always ſay to ourſelves, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did to his Miſtriſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>How can I do this wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God,</hi> and that even in his ſight? For <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>All things are naked and open in the ſight of him, with whom we have to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe ſame Texts, that prove Gods Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, they alſo prove his fourth Attribute, Omniſcience, That He ſees, and knows all things. And as for the next Attribute, His perfect Goodneſs, you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what your Saviour ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.17. <hi>There is none Good, but one, that is God, i. e.</hi> None deſerving this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Good, in ſtrictneſs, but he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. <hi>He is Good, and doth Good, and that continually.</hi> And who that is wiſe will not love, and ſerve, and ſtrive to pleaſe ſo Good a God?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> By <hi>Adams</hi> fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Theſe and the following Queſtions and Anſwers, are neceſſary to ſhew you how all mankind came to ſtand in need of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Bleſſed Trinity, coming in the fleſh to be their Redeemer, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.29. <hi>This I have found out,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, That God made man upright, but they ſought out many inventions.</hi> The Hiſtory whereof you have in the ſecond and third Chapters of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> The ſumm whereof is this. God gave our firſt Parents a ſpecial Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104488:23"/>for the proof of their Obedience, <hi>viz.</hi> not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, with this Sanction, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, Thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> But they liſtned to the Temptations of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, the Devil, who hating God, and envying the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of man, belied God, ſaying, they ſhould not die, but only God forbad this fruit, leſt they ſhould be as Gods knowing good and evil, and to him they heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſo fell from God, and from that ſtate of innocency wherein he created them, by ſinning againſt him.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How can</hi> Adams <hi>fall concern his poſterity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Covenant being made with <hi>Adam,</hi> not only for himſelf, but alſo for his poſterity, therefore all Mankind deſcending from him by Ordinary Generation, ſinned in him and fell with him in his firſt Tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What Covenant ſpake you of now?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The old Covenant of works made with <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall, as a publick perſon, repreſenting all mankind, that ſhould deſcend of his Loyns.</p>
               <p>Q. Chriſt Jeſus <hi>deſcended from</hi> Adam; <hi>Did he then fall in him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for he deſcended from <hi>Adam</hi> by an extraordinary Generation, and ſo took our nature, without the ſinfulneſs and corruption of our nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> I pray mark that expreſſion well, (all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that deſcended from <hi>Adam</hi> by ordinary Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) for this is purpoſely intended to except Chriſt, who was conceived in the Virgins Womb in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner, by the power of the Holy ghoſt, and born of her, being ſtill a pure Virgin, having no
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104488:24"/>Knowledge of man, ſo that taking our nature in an extraordinary way of Generation, he received our nature free from, and Untainted with the ſinfulneſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature. But all others deſcending from <hi>Adam</hi> in an ordinary way of Generation, are inwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in his Guilt, as their common parent, Head, and Repreſentative. So that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.2.

               <p>Q. <hi>In what eſtate then are all men beſides</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>that are born of</hi> Adam <hi>ſince the fall?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Guilty of ſin, and prone to all ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Guilty of Sin. For <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>By one mans Diſobedience, many are made ſinners.</hi> And then (which is that corruption of nature I ſpake of) they are prone to all ſin, and I add, averſe to all good. For <hi>Adam</hi> begat ſons and daughters after his own Image, The Image of Corruption. A corrupt Tree will have corrupt fruit. Hence that unanſwerable queſtion of <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>What Dangers are we liable to, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Original Guilt and proneneſs to ſin in our nature, and the actual ſins of our lives?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q What means have we to be delivered from theſe ſins and Dangers to which for ſin we are liable?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Only by our Saviour and Redeemer, the ſecond perſon in the Bleſſed Trinity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt,</hi> Thus are we orderly led to what the Creed teaches us to believe concerning him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 89.19. <hi>God laid help upon one that is mighty, and exalted one choſen out of the people.</hi> And this One ſo choſen, Mighty to ſave, ſo loved the world, that he freely and willingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook it, ſaying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7. <hi>Lo, I come, it is written of me, I come to do thy will, O God.</hi> And from hence is he called, <hi>The Angel of the Covenant,</hi> Mal. 3.1. For he came to found and eſtabliſh a new Covenant betwixt God and man, and to work a reconciliation, to found a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying Covenant after the former was broken and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, and ſo became he a Saviour of men, <hi>The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the name of our Saviour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What do thoſe names ſignifie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Jeſus</hi> is a <hi>Hebrew</hi> name ſignifying as much as Saviour, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>Greek,</hi> and ſignifies (as the word <hi>Meſſiah</hi> doth) a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Anointed to the threefold office of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prieſt, and King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> The Angel appointed him his Name <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> to <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> at the Annunciation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.20. <hi>His name ſhall be called Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> And then they, <hi>When the eight days were accompliſhed for the circumciſing of the child, ſo called him, being Sir named by the Angel before he was conceived in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104488:25"/>Womb,</hi> Luk. 2.21. As for his other name (<hi>Chriſt,</hi> or in <hi>Hebrew, Meſſiah</hi>) it is equivalent to our Sirnames, and ſignifies his Office, being in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as much as The Anointed one. For God Anointed him with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt, <hi>the oyl of gladneſs, above his Fellows,</hi> Pſ. 45.7. And as it was proper to three ſorts of perſons to be Anointed, Kings, and Prieſts, and Prophets, ſo was he anointed King, Pſ. 2.6. <hi>Yet have I ſet my King upon my Holy Hill of Sion.</hi> And Prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. <hi>He was made High Prieſt, after the order of Melchizedek.</hi> And Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, for of him <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.45. <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your Brethren like unto me, Him ſhall ye hear.</hi> And in fullfilling theſe offices, of making Atonement for our ſins, by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of himſelf upon the Croſs, and continual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us, as a Prieſt; teaching us his Fathers Will for our Salvation, as a Prophet; and ruling and protecting us as a King, conſiſts that great Salvation, which he, as our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> wrought and workt for us, and which is offered to us in his Holy Goſpel. Now being thus ſet forth to us by his Names, next he is deſcribed to us in the Creed by his Natures.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>for his perſon, God only, or Man only, or both God and man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Both God and man: Man, that he might be capable of ſuffering in the ſame nature wherein we had ſinned: and God, that he might be able to give full ſatisfaction for our ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> It is written, that <hi>without ſhedding of blood there can be no remiſſion,</hi> Heb. 9.22. For ſo had God threatned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In the day thou ſinneſt, thou ſhalt dye the death.</hi> As therefore God would be true to his Word, it was neceſſary for our Redeemer to be man, that he might be capable of ſuffering death for our ſins,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104488:25"/>in the ſame nature wherein they were committed. And as neceſſary it was for him to be God, that he might be able to ſatisfie; That his death and ſufferings might by the Dignity of his perſon be of infinite value, to ſatisfie the infinite debt of our ſins to Gods juſtice. For <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.4. <hi>It was not poſſible, that the bloud of Bulls and Goats offered in ſacrifice, ſhould take away ſins:</hi> But all the vertue they had, was as Types and Figures of the pretious Blood of Chriſt the Son of God, <hi>as of a Lamb without ſpot and without blemiſh,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18. So, God he muſt be, whoſoever will undertake to ſatisfie for our ſins, by ſuffering for them, and God he was, who purchaſed his Church with his own blood, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How prove you by your Creed then, that</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is true God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I believe Him to be His, to wit, Gods only Son, our Lord.</p>

                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> The Son of God muſt needs be God: God of God, very God of very God. Now God owned him for his Son, by a voice from heaven at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This is my beloved ſon, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Now to anticipate an Objection, the next Queſtion and Anſwer ſhews how our being Gods Sons, differs from His being ſo. And thereof the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. compared with chap. 2.1, 3. gives a very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able application.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Are not we alſo Sons of God, and how then is he Gods only Son, or how doth his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods Son, prove him to be God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We are only Sons of God by Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt: but Chriſt is Gods Son by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Generation, He is Gods only begotten Son, very God of very God, as really God of the ſubſtance of the Father, begotten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104488:26"/>the World, as he was Man of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Mother born in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.13. <hi>Let us hold faſt this form of ſound words in Faith and Love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and always carry in mind the Apoſtles inference from it, in the forequoted place. God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake in times paſt to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the Prophets, Hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken to us by his Son (as the Great Mediator between Him and us) Therefore we ought to give the more earneſt heed, to the things we hear, leſt at any time we let them ſlip. For <hi>if the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience received a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward, How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salvation, which at the firſt began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us, by them that heard him?</hi> Let us paſs on then to the other proof of Chriſts Divinity.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How did Chriſt become our Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He both made us, and redeemed us with his pretious blood, and we have in Baptiſm given up ourſelves to him, to be his Servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Pſ. 100.3. <hi>He made us, and not we ourſelves.</hi> So is he our Lord, as we are his Creatures. For <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>All things were made by him, and without him was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing made that was made.</hi> And being loſt he alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us, ſo that he is our Lord by right of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>He bought us with a price,</hi> therefore we are not our own, but his; therefore is he our Lord. And being ſo our Lord, he is certainly God: for who but <hi>God is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> Rev. 1.6. and who but God can be called by that incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Name of God, <hi>Jehova,</hi> and ſo is Chriſt, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>I will have mercy upon them, and will ſave them by the Lord, Jehova, and not by how or ſheild.</hi> O what cauſe have we then, to own him for our Lord, by devoting our
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104488:26"/>ſelves to his Service! Caſt we then our eyes upon the other Nature of his.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How prove you by your Creed, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is true man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I believe him to be Conceived in the Womb, by the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> An anſwer containing what the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Calls the great Myſtery of Godlineſs, God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> Nay, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Word made fleſh.</hi> and thus runs the Argument to prove Chriſts Manhood, He had an Human Conception, and Human Birth; was conceived like other men, and was born of a woman as other men are, and therefore he was Man. For further underſtanding of all its particulars, I ask you,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Had Chriſt any natural Father as Man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>By what power then was he Conceived in, and born of a woman?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the power of the Holy ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Of this we are aſſured by the Angel which ſaid unto <hi>Mary,</hi> Luk. 1.31. <hi>Thou ſhalt conceive and bear a Son,</hi> &amp;c. and when ſhe demanded <hi>How can this be, ſeeing I know not a man?</hi> he anſwered her, ver. 35. <hi>The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the Higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee, Therefore that Holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> So, by the Bleſſed Virgins proteſtation, it is evident, ſhe knew not a man, therefore had her Son no natural Father.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What do you learn from that?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That taking our nature of her ſubſtance in ſuch an extraordinary way, the Holy Ghoſt purifying it, He took it without ſin, being to ſuffer for our ſins.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:104488:27"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> For <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>Such muſt our High Prieſt be, Holy, harmleſs, and undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners.</hi> He muſt have no ſin of his own, who undertook to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Gods Juſtice for our ſins.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Who was this Virgin Mary?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> She was of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> of which Tribe the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> That ſhe was of that Tribe appears by Chriſts pedegree or Genealogy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. as alſo by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph's</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>'s going to be taxed at <hi>Bethlehem Judah,</hi> for this very reaſon, becauſe they were of that Tribe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.3, 4.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How then do you prove Chriſt to be the true Meſſiah?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All the Prophecies were exactly fulfilled in him, as to his Tribe, parents, place and time of Birth, and his manner of Life, and Death, and Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> The Meſſiah, the Saviour of the world was foretold to come of <hi>the Tribe of Judah, of the root of Jeſſe and houſe of David,</hi> Luk. 1.27. <hi>to be conceived of a Virgin,</hi> Iſa. 7.14. <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive,</hi> &amp;c. and for the place, to be born <hi>in Bethlehem.</hi> Micah 5.2. <hi>And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah, art not the leaſt of the Princes of Judah, for out of thee ſhall come a Governour that ſhall rule my people Iſrael.</hi> And for the Time, <hi>to come as Shile, when the Scepter ſhould be departed from Judah,</hi> Gen 49.10. And after the Seventy weeks was determined, by <hi>Daniel,</hi> ch 9.24. and while the ſecond Temple ſtood, by the Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> chap. 2.9. which within Fourty years after Chriſt, was demoliſhed, ſo that not one ſtone was left upon another. And the purity of his life, and the cruelty and violence offered him in his death, are clearly ſpoken of by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 53. throughout. And his Reſurrection by the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſ. 16.11. So that all things came to paſs according to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104488:27"/>the Prophecy. Learn this argument therefore againſt all Jews and Infidels Nothing befel Chriſt which was not foretold, and nothing was foretold, which was not exactly fulfilled in Chriſt, therefore he was certainly the true Chriſt or Meſſiah which was to come into the world.</p>
               <p>Thus have you what your Creed teacheth you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, of your Saviours Names and Natures. Now ſee and learn what his work of Salvation and Redemption was which he wrought, or the manner of his working it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How did Chriſt effect the great work of our Redemption?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By his lowly Humiliation, wherein he ſhewed the Truth of his Manhood: and by his Glorious Exaltation, wherein did ſhine the bright raies of his Godhead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> You have both theſe in one notable Text of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> Phil. 2.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Being in the form of God, He thought it no robbery to be equal with God, But made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men, and being found in faſhion as a man, He humbled himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God alſo hath highly exalted him,</hi> &amp;t.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Wherein conſiſts Chriſts lowly Humiliation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In that he ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> was Crucified, dead and buried, and deſcended into Hell for us.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Wherein conſiſts Chriſts Glorious Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In that he by his own power roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the third day from the dead, aſcended into Heaven, and ſitteth at the right Hand of God the Father Almighty, and from thence
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104488:28"/>ſhall come again to judge all, both quick and dead.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>When did Chriſt ſuffer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was when <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperours Deputy, was Governour of <hi>Judea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Matth. 27.1, 2. <hi>The Chief Prieſts and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the people, took councel together to put him to death. And when they had bound him, they led him away, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him to Pentius Pilate the Governour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why is this expreſſed in the Creed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To ſhew it was now the ſet time fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told for the Meſſiah's coming, The Scepter was now, according to <hi>Jacobs</hi> Prophecy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Judah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> had now been Sixty years ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, and his Governours, or Deputies, ſo that <hi>Jacobs</hi> Prophecy concerning the time of the <hi>Shilo's</hi> coming, was now exactly fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Was it neceſſary for Chriſt to ſuffer? and to ſuffer death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: Both Types and Prophecies fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told it, and our ſins deſerved it, and he muſt die to deſtroy death, and to ſatisfie the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God for our ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> The killing of the Sacrifices under the Law, and the Paſchal Lamb ſlain, were Eminent Types of Chriſts death. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> clearly foretold His being cut off out of the land of the Living, and all the Prophets wrote, that the Son of man ſhould <hi>ſuffer many things,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.11. Our ſins deſerved death, <hi>the wages
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104488:28"/>of ſin</hi> being <hi>death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. He therefore muſt die for them, as a ſacrifice to Gods Juſtice, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He who knew no ſin, became ſin for us, i. e.</hi> a Sacrifice for ſin, and no other way but by death, could He <hi>deſtroy death,</hi> and him that hath the power of death, <hi>the Devil,</hi> Heb. 2.13.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What manner of Death did Chriſt ſuffer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The accurſed death of the Croſs. To free us from the Curſe, He became a Curſe for us.</p>
               <p>Catechiſt. <hi>Iſaac's</hi> bearing the Wood for the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the Brazen Serpent being lifted up upon the Pole, were Types of this ſort of death: and not a Bone of the Paſchal Lamb to be broken when it was ſlain, and the Prophecies of piercing his hands and his feet, plainly pointed at the manner how Chriſt was to die, even by Crucifying, for theſe were circumſtances uſual therein. And laſtly, let us always remember that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. that it being an accurſed death, (for it is written, <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree,</hi> Deut. 21.23.) <hi>He thereby redeemed us from the Curſe, by being made a curſe for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why was Chriſt buried?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To ſweeten the Grave for us, and to Conquer death in his own proper place and Dominion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> So was it foretold, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. <hi>I will ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome them from the power of the Grave; I will redeem them from death. O death, I will be thy plague, O Grave, I will be thy Deſtruction.</hi> And hence the Apoſtle's Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56, 57. <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law, but thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:104488:29"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>How did Chriſt deſcend into Hell?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All men grant he continued in the ſtate of the dead for a time, both as to his body and as to his Soul, and did ſo deſcend into Hell, as to free me and all Believers from Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Of this the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpake in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophecy moſt clearly, ſaying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell,</hi> and the Apoſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.31. quotes it, and applies it to Chriſt, ſo that it is certain he deſcended into Hell, but for the manner how, there have been great Controverſies about it, and the ſafeſt reſolution is, to adhere to what all grant, till God ſhall clearly reveal it to us.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What uſe muſt we make of Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and his death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To hate ſin, which cauſed Chriſts death in ſo cruel a manner; to admire Chriſts Love in thus dying, that we may live, and to die to ſin as Chriſt dyed for ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> We muſt as the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> teacheth, chap. 12.10. <hi>Look upon him whom we have peirced, i. e.</hi> by our ſins, for they were Chriſts Murderers, His enemies but the Inſtruments thereof. We muſt therefore look upon him with tears of unfeigned repentance for them: and wo be to them who by repeating their ſins, and a continued Impenitency therein, <hi>crucifie the ſon of God afreſh!</hi> Heb. 6.6. On the contrary therefore, Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and admire Chriſts love in dying for us: for <hi>John</hi> 15.13. <hi>Greater Love hath no man than to lay down his life for his friend.</hi> But <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>God commended his love to us, that while we were yet ſinners,</hi> and ſo his enemies, <hi>Chriſt died for us.</hi> And O! therefore as he died for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104488:29"/>ſin, ſo let us die unto ſin, and no longer live therein. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Let us reckon ourſelves to be dead unto ſin, but alive unto righteouſneſs.</hi> For 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>He his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead unto ſin, ſhould live unto righteouſneſs.</hi> And thus <hi>by his ſtripes we ſhall be healed.</hi> Thus have you now the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſts lowly Humiliation.

               <p>Q. <hi>Did Chriſt, being dead, remain under the power of Death?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, he roſe again from the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Pſal. 16.10. <hi>God did not ſuffer his Holy one to ſee corruption.</hi> Rom. 6.9. <hi>Death could have no Dominion over him,</hi> at leaſt not keep it; but he Conquered it in its proper hold the Grave, and as many eye witneſſes aſſure us, <hi>He reſe again according to the Scriptures,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.4.</p>

               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To teach his diſciples the things of his Kingdome, that is, to Commiſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them how to gather and fettle his Church throughout the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Act. 1.3. <hi>He ſhewed himſelf to his Apoſtles alive after his paſſion by many infallible proofs, being ſeen of them Fourty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God;</hi> which is his Church. And for the gathering thereof, we find <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. He gave them this Commiſſion, <hi>Go, Teach all Nations</hi> (or diſciple all Nations) <hi>baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing and governing the Church ſo gathered, He
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104488:30"/>then gave them this General direction, teaching them to <hi>do whatſoever I have commanded you: And loe I am with you always to the end of the world,</hi> is the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe wherewith he then encouraged them in this work. And during this time it was that he called upon <hi>Peter</hi> in ſpecial, but doubtleſs therein requiring it of all the other Apoſtles, <hi>Peter loveſt thou me? ſeed my ſheep, Loveſt thou me? feed my lambs,</hi> John 21.15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Whither went he after theſe Fourty days?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He aſcended into Heaven.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What to do there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To prepare a place for us, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to make interceſſion for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Heb. 9.11, 12. <hi>Our High Prieſt entred into the moſt Holy place, having obtained Eternal Redemption for us.</hi> Act. 1.19. <hi>While they were ſpeaking with him.</hi> Luk. 24.50. <hi>While he bleſſed them, the Diſciples beheld, and loe he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ſight.</hi> Now of this ſpeaks St. <hi>Ambroſe's</hi> Song, called <hi>Te Deum, He opened the Kingdom of heaven to all believers.</hi> For ſee what he himſelf ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 14.2. <hi>In my fathers houſe are many Manſions; I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to my ſelf, that, where I am, ye may be alſo.</hi> Wherefore (as the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. inferreth hence) <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt them that come to God by Him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What place hath Chriſt now in Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He in our nature ſits at the right hand of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> So himſelf foretold his enemies, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.69. <hi>Hereafter ſhall ye ſee the Son of man ſitting at the right hand of power.</hi> And hereof many Texts aſſure us,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104488:31"/>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the Right hand of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q <hi>Hath God any hands, either right hand or left?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: God is a Spirit, and hath neither bodily parts nor paſſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> So doth Chriſt himſelf define God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. <hi>God is a Spirit.</hi> And <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.19. He thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes a Spirit, <hi>that it hath no bodily parts. Handle me and ſee, for a Spirit hath neither fleſh nor bones as ye ſee me have.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What mean you then by Chriſts ſitting at Gods right hand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I mean his fulneſs of Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty as God-man, with infinite power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his, and his Churches enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> So he told his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. <hi>All power is given to me in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> Such power, that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. <hi>His enemies are his footſtool.</hi> Eph. 1.20. <hi>He is far above all principalities, and powers, and might and Dominion, and every name that is named, both in this world, and the world to come.</hi> For <hi>Act.</hi> 2.34, 35. <hi>Him whom they crucified, hath God thus made, both Lord and Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Will Chriſt ever come again from Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: with Holy Angels, in great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What to do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To judge all men, both them that are alive at his coming, and all them that died from the beginning of the World.</p>

                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Read often I pray you what deſcription the Apoſtle gives hereof, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>That day of the Lord ſhall come as a thief in the night,</hi> for when <hi>men ſhall ſay, peace and ſafety, then cometh ſudden deſtruction upon them, as travel upon a woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To riſe again with Chriſt unto all newneſs of life, to ſet our affections on things above, where Chriſt is, To ſerve him with fear, becauſe all power is given him, and to judge ourſelves daily, and to watch over all our thoughts, words, and actions, as they that muſt give account thereof at Chriſts tribunal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> All theſe the Scripture ſplainly teach us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>We are buried with Chriſt by Baptiſm, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of his Father; even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life.</hi> And this is the proper uſe to be made of Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: for it follows there, <hi>having been planted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo planted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the likeneſs of his Reſurrection.</hi> Col. 3.1. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt is ſet at the Right hand of God.</hi> This is the uſe we are to make of Chriſts Aſcenſion and ſitting at the Right hand of God.

And ſeeing all theſe things ſhall be then diſſolved, let us ſeriouſly conſider, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> 2 Ep. 3.11. admoniſheth us, <hi>What manner of perſons we ought to be in all manner of Converſation and Godlineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have you what the Creed teacheth you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the two firſt perſons in the bleſſed Trinity. The Father and the Son; now</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What doſt thou believe concerning the Third Perſon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I believe that he is God the Holy Ghoſt, Proceeding from the Father and the Son, One with them, Holy in himſelf, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all Holineſs in us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> I ſhall further explain to you, and prove the ſeveral parts of this Anſwer in the following Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and their anſwers. I ask you then</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is not the Father a Spirit, and was not the Son alſo a pure Spirit, before he took our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: But the Holy Ghoſt is the Spirit of the Father, and of the Son, inſpired or proceeding from them both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> True, and from hence he is called <hi>the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Father,</hi> Matth. 10.20. And <hi>the ſpirit of the Son,</hi> Gal. 4.6. And as <hi>the Father ſent the ſpirit,</hi> John 14.26. So the Son promiſed his Diſciples to <hi>ſend the ſpirit when he left them to the wide world.</hi> John 15.26. <hi>When the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104488:33"/>Comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father, even the ſpirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He ſhall teſtifie of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is the Holy Ghoſt God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: He is One with, and Equal to the Father and the Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Being one with, and equal to them, he muſt neceſſarily be God, very God. For being three perſons, they are but one God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are three that bear record in Heaven, The Father, the Word, and the Spirit, and theſe three are One.</hi> Beſides which plain Text to prove the Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt, There is one General Argument, which is not hard to learn or remember, for arming yourſelves againſt all ſuch Hereticks as deny the Holy Ghoſt, to be God, as well as our Saviour. The name of God, the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, the Works of God, and the Honours which belong to God alone, are aſcribed to the Holy Ghoſt; Therefore the Holy Ghoſt is God. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly we are all Baptized, as in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, ſo in the name of the Holy Ghoſt. And here in the Creed we profeſs to believe in the Holy Ghoſt, as well as as in God the Father, and in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the only Son of God. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in, is an honour peculiar to God. We may not believe in any Creature, in any but God. For it implies Truſt and Affiance, and <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Curſed is he, that truſts in any Arm of fleſh.</hi> To name only one Text more, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.3. When <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> lied to the Holy Ghoſt, concerning the price of their lands, they are expreſsly ſaid, <hi>to lie to God, and not to men.</hi> Therefore the Holy Ghoſt is God.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>Why is he called the Holy Spirit, or the Holy Ghoſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:104488:33"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Being Holy in himſelf, he Sanctifies us, and all our Holineſs is his work, he is the Author of all Holineſs in us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Holineſs is his Eſſential Attribute: and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, or making us Holy, is his proper Work. And hence we read of the <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.13. and of the <hi>renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Tit. 3.5. And hereby <hi>he ſeals us to the day of Redemption,</hi> Epheſ. 4.30.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>By what means doth the spirit Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Holy Scriptures were written by men inſpired by the ſpirit, and he daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens, converts, ſanctifies and comforts our ſouls by them in the Miniſtry of the Word.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What muſt we then do, that the spirit may Sanctifie us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We muſt highly eſteem, and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend Gods Holy Ordinances, and obey all the Holy Spirit's godly motions in our hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> The Spirit moves in theſe waters, as in the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> to heal the diſeaſes of our Souls, and we are therefore warned <hi>to take heed that we do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,</hi> Epheſ. 4.30. nor <hi>quench the ſpirit,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.19. Which is done, as by any will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful groſs ſin, <hi>ſo by despiſing prophecying,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.20. by ſlighting, neglecting or making light of any of Gods Holy Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Thus have you what the Creed teaches you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, concerning the Holy Ghoſt alſo, and ſo concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the Perſons in the Bleſſed Trinity. Proceed we then to what it teacheth concerning the Church.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Neither can the Pope, nor any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſon upon Earth, be truly called the Church. For it is a Company, a Body conſiſting of many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And hence Chriſt calls it a flock, though it be a little flock in compariſon of the whole world, that lyes in wickedneſs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Fear not little flock, for it is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> 2 Ep. 2.9. uſeth theſe Plural and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective words, calling the Church <hi>a choſen generation, a Royal Prieſthood, an Holy nation, a peculiar people.

               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What ſignifies this word</hi> (<hi>Catholick.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a <hi>Greek</hi> word, and is as much as Univerſal.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:104488:44"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>What mean you by believing the Church, to be Catholick or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. That Gods Church is not now confined to any one place, or people, as it was under the Old Teſtament, but all that are called, in any Age, or Place, are now of the Catholick Church, being United into one Myſtical body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Under the Old Teſtament, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.1, 2. <hi>In Judah was God known, His name was great in Iſrael, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem was his Tabernacle, and his dwelling place was in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Pſal. 147.19, 10. <hi>He ſhewed his word unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and his judgments unto Iſrael, He dealt not ſo with any Other nation, neither had the Heathen knowledge of his Law.</hi> But now under the Goſpel or New Teſtament, The partition wall between Jew and Gentile, being by Chriſts Death broken down, Both are become <hi>one ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold under one Shepherd.</hi> And according to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to Chriſt, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>The Heathen are given to him for an Inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the Earth for a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</hi> So that now, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34, 35. <hi>God is no Accepter of perſons: But in every nation, He that feareth God and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſneſs is accepted with him.</hi> And hence S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9. <hi>That he in his viſion beheld, and loe a great multitude which no man could number of all nations, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and people, and tongues, ſtood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, Crying with a loud voice, Salvation to our God, that ſitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Who is the Head of this Myſtical Body, the Catholick Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No man living but Chriſt only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> It is pride and preſumption in the Pope to claim this Honour which belongs to Chriſt alone.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104488:45"/>For <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. <hi>He alone is Head of the Church, who is the Saviour of the Body.</hi> Col. 1.18. <hi>He is the Head of the Body,</hi> the Church, <hi>Who is the beginning, the firſt born from the dead, that in all things he might have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence. For it pleaſeth the Father, that in him all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould dwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Hath God always had a Church on Earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: and will have to the end of the world; it can never be deſtroyed utterly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> It was Chriſts promiſe to his Diſciples, and in them to his Church, <hi>(All that through them ſhould afterwards believe in his name) To be with them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to the end of the world,</hi> Matth. 28.20.

               <p>Q. <hi>Can any one Church, as that of</hi> Rome, <hi>call it ſelf the Catholick Church, in oppoſition to other Churches?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, no more than <hi>Rome</hi> can be called the whole world.</p>
               <p>Catechiſt. <hi>Rome</hi> is at the beſt, but one Member of the Catholick Church of Chriſt, and can no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called the Catholick Church, than either It, or any one Particular place can be called the whole World.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is Chriſts Church always viſible upon Earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That of ſincere Chriſtians is inviſible; That of all Chriſtian profeſſors is viſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> The Church Viſible is <hi>the Light of the world, and a City ſet upon an Hill, which cannot be hid,</hi> Mat. 5.14.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104488:45"/>It is alway viſible, at leaſt, to them that are of it, and profeſs Chriſtianity. But ſometimes it may be ſo perſecuted as to flee <hi>like the woman into the Wilderneſs, where ſhe hath a place prepared for her, for that time of perſecution;</hi> Rev. 12.6. and then it is not ſo viſible as to be glorious, and to proſper and flouriſh in the eyes of the world.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why is Chriſts Church ſaid to be Holy, an Holy Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe of its better part, ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in it; and becauſe of its Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Gods commands, and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of true Holineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. <hi>It is an Holy Nation, a peculiar people.</hi> Rev. 21.2. <hi>It's an Holy City, the new Jeruſalem.</hi> Not but that there is a mixture of good and bad, godly and prophane in the Church: for our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the Church, which he calls the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.24. <hi>to a field, wherein tares grow up with the wheat.</hi> And ver. 47. <hi>to a draw-net, that incloſeth both good fiſh and bad,</hi> with divers others of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But the Church is Holy, as for its Holy things, ſo becauſe all its members do or ſhould profeſs Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is a company or Congregation of men, <hi>who are called with an holy calling,</hi> or Vocation. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. For <hi>every man that nameth the name of Chriſt,</hi> or on whom the name of Chriſt is called, being called Chriſtian, is bound <hi>to depart from Iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But who then are they that are truly Holy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Such as believe aright, and live an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably: ſuch as evidence the truth of a lively Faith, and Unfeigned Repentance, by conſtant Obedience to Gods Will revealed in his Word.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:104488:46"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> So I have often told you, for St. <hi>James</hi> 2.18. ſaith <hi>Shew me thy Faith by thy works.</hi> And he there argues it at large, that good Works of Obedience, are the only things, that can evidence a mans Faith to be true, and alive and not dead, or no better than that Faith of Devils, who believe and tremble.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What duties doth our believing the Holy Catholick Church oblige us all to?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Carefully to practice Holineſs ourſelves, and by all means to take heed of Schiſms, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and Separations from Gods Church; for thereby we ſhall loſe all viſible Hopes of Salvation.</p>
               <p>Catechiſt. <hi>I therefore a priſoner of the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1. <hi>beſeech you, that ye walk worthy of the Vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowlineſs and meekneſs, endeavoring to keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit, in the Bond of peace,</hi> that is, Unity in Spiritual things. For (as he goes on argumentatively) <hi>There is one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and one Spirit, one Faith, one Lord, one Baptiſm, One God and Father of all.</hi> All which (Ones) the Apoſtle argueth, ſhould oblige us to be One, to keep faſt the Unity, and by no means to ſeparate from the one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Church. And indeed to divide from the one Church, and fall into Schiſms, is a ſort of renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing this Article of our Creed, I Believe the one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. We cannot (verily) heartily believe this, unleſs we follow the Apoſtles Rule, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. <hi>I beſeech you Brethren, Mark them which cauſe Diviſions among you, and avoid them.</hi> And need we had to do ſo, for there is great Truth in the old ſaying. Out of the Church, no Salvation; for it is Gods way <hi>to add to the Church,</hi> not to divide from it <hi>thoſe that ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Act. 2.47. Now after the Church, let us conſider the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and promiſes wherewith this Church is enriched.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:104488:46"/>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Communion of Saints, The For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Which be thoſe two in the Life To come?</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> The Reſurrection of the Body, and the Life Everlaſting.</p>

                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> And ſurely it hugely concerns you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand each of theſe things well and diſtinctly. To which purpoſe, for the Communion of Saints in the firſt place, I ask you</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What do you mean by Saints?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The members of Chriſts Church, who being in part holy here, ſhall be perfect Saints hereafter in heavenly glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Saints is as much as Holy Ones. And all the members of the Church <hi>called to be Saints,</hi> Rom. 1.7. For they are <hi>called unto Holineſs,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.7. It is their duty and profeſſion <hi>to follow Holineſs,</hi> Heb. 12.14. and to go on <hi>to perfect Holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. For being redeemed by Chriſt, and delivered from the hands of their enemies, it is that they may <hi>ſerve God without fear, in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs before him all the days of their lives,</hi> Luk. 1.75.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>With whom have thoſe Saints Communion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> With the Bleſſed Trinity, as Sons of God, by Faith and prayer; and with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all Ordinances of piety, and all Offices of Charity, as Brethren.</p>
               <p>Catechiſt. <hi>That which we have heard and ſeen,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104488:47"/>S. <hi>John</hi> 1 Ep. 1.3. <hi>We declare unto you, that ye may have fellowſhip with us; and truly Our fellowſhip is with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> With theſe, the Saints have fellowſhip and Communion, by all Acts of Faith, and Love, and all Holy affections, and in Gods Holy Ordinances, as in divers inſtances, ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in that God and Chriſt Communicates to them the riches of his Bleſſings, Mercies and Conſolations, through the merits of Chriſt, and they acquaint him with all their wants, and troubles, and neceſſities, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in him. And as for that fellowſhip, they have with one another, it conſiſts in divers particulars, as (to name ſome) They Sympathize with, and have a fellow feeling of one anothers miſeries, ſufferings, and afflictions, <hi>as fellow members one of another.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.26. <hi>Whether one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it, or one member be honoured, all the members rejoyce with it.</hi> Rom. 12.15. <hi>They rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and weep with them that weep.</hi> They <hi>pray continually,</hi> and praiſe God for each others welfare, ſaying, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. And what Gifts and Bleſſings any one enjoyeth, He readily and willingly imployes, and Communicates them for ſupply, relief, and helping others that want them, whether Wiſdom, Wealth or Power.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is our duty, as Believers of this Communion of Saints?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To hold faſt this Communion, that we may receive and impart the Benefits of Gods Mercies, and each others Gifts; and to take heed of all cauſeleſs ſeparations from Gods Church, or one another in matters of Faith, Worſhip and Charity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> I beſeech you, (good Children) learn theſe leſſons, and lay them up in your hearts, that you may walk ſteadily, and not waver in your Holy Religion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104488:47"/>to your lives end. If you truly believe the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, you muſt follow the Apoſtles Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation cloſely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>I beſeech you Brethren, by the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, That ye all ſpeak the ſame things, and that there be no Diviſions amongſt you, but that ye be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment.</hi> Phil. 2.1, 2. <hi>If there be any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the ſpirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, and of one mind.

               <p>Q. <hi>What is it to believe the Forgiveneſs of ſins?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That Gods juſtice is ſatisfied through the Merits of Chriſts blood, and through them there is mercy, and pardon may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for all our ſins, if we do but heartily repent, and forſake them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Pſal. 130.4. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> How comes this to paſs? <hi>through Chriſt,</hi> Act. 13.38. <hi>Through this man is preached to you forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> Upon what account? becauſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. <hi>He gave his life a ranſome for us.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.4. <hi>He died for our ſins according to the Scriptures. He was made ſin for us, who knew no ſin.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. that is, a Sacrifice to ſuffer death for our ſins in our ſtead. So hath he purchaſed a pardon for all ſinners, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104488:48"/>will but accept of it, upon the condition upon which it is offered them, which I ſhall chooſe to expreſs in the words of the Evangelical Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous man his imaginations, and return unto the Lord, for he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To reverence my Body, and not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute it to be an Inſtrument of ſin or fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs: and neither to fear death my ſelf, nor to mourn immoderately for the death of my Friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Great cauſe have we to bear reverence to our own bodies, ſo as not to abuſe them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of ſin or filthineſs, by overcharging them with ſurfeting or drunkenneſs, or by fulfilling our fleſhly luſts, in fornication or beaſtly living, ſeeing they are at preſent <hi>Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, which dwelleth in us,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19.

               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Do the Godly Merit or deſerve that Bliſs, as the wicked do that puniſhment and Torments?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; Our beſt good works are due debt, and but imperfect, and Gods Gift, and bears no proportion to the reward, and therefore though death be the wages of ſin, yet Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life is the Gift of God.</p>
               <p>

Our beſt good works cannot merit any good thing of God, for they are but due debt, as our Saviour teacheth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. <hi>When we have done all, we muſt ſay, we are unprofitable ſervants;</hi> We have but done that which was our duty to do. And (2.) Our beſt good works are imperfect, tainted with many ſins and infirmities, ſo that they themſelves, ſtand in need of Gods pardon, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 64.6, 7. <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, All our Righteouſneſs is but as filthy rags, and as a menſtruous cloth, and great are the iniquities of our moſt Holy things.</hi> So that <hi>if God ſhould be extreme to mark what we do amiſs in them, O Lord, who may abide it,</hi> Pſal. 130.3. And (3) all we have and do is Gods Gift, it is he that <hi>worketh in us, both to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2.13. and we give him but his own. Nor, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo good can it (4) bear any proportion to that <hi>recompence of reward,</hi> which God promiſeth us.

                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> This is the uſe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes of this great Doctrine of Chriſtianity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he exhorts thus upon account hereof, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Let us not therefore look at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen.

               <p>Thus have you had the Rule and Summary of the Chriſtian Faith in the Creed. Now having often taught you, that there is no true Faith without Obedience, I pray</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> The Moral Law contained in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> You remember, Brethren, I hope, that you promiſed in your Baptiſm, as to believe all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Chriſtian Faith, ſo to keep Gods Holy Will and Commandments.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How many Commandments are there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Ten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Theſe Ten Commandments contain that which we call the Moral Law; and it is ſo called, becauſe it orders our Manners, and our whole lives and converſations, both towards God and towards men. Concerning which I would only teach you, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Antinomian Errors, that this Moral Law contained in the Ten Commandments, is ſtill in force
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104488:51"/>to us; and as it was the Rule of life, and manners, and Obedience to Gods ancient people the Jews; ſo is it ſtill to us Chriſtians. For whatever moral duties God Commanded the Jews, (being his choſen people) under the Old Teſtament; the ſame doth Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us Chriſtians, under the Goſpel, and that while the world laſts; for he ſaid expreſsly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17. <hi>He came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it;</hi> and reciting ſeveral Commandments, He abrogated none, but (which ſhews their obligation on us ſufficiently) ſhewed their true and Spiritual meaning againſt the corrupt gloſſes the Phariſees had put upon them, thereby making them of no effect. <hi>It was ſaid of old time</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, but I ſay unto you, Whoſoever is angry with his Brother without a cauſe, is in danger of the judgment.</hi> Again, ver. 27. <hi>It was ſaid of old time, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, But I ſay unto you, Whoſoever looketh on a woman to luſt after her</hi> in his heart, <hi>Committeth Adultery with her.</hi> And thus doth He there Explain other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, but Repeals none of them: and in ſhort, St, <hi>James</hi> ſaith, chap. 2.8. of all the reſt, <hi>If ye fulfil the Royal Law of Liberty, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf, ye ſhall do well.</hi> Nor is the number of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments impertinent to be obſerved, it being ſo preciſely noted by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Ten,</hi> and no more, which puzzles them of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion, to make them ſo, while they leave out the ſecond in their Catechiſm; becauſe it ſo apparently condemns their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage worſhip, and then for a mere ſhift, they would divide the laſt Commandment, making two of one. And now before we cloſe with the Commandments, we muſt not neglect the Preface to them, <hi>(God ſpake theſe words and ſaid, I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of Bondage.)</hi> which what it imports you may learn by the next Queſtion and Anſwer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, His Sovereignty, For he is the Lord. (2) His near Relation to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for He is the Lord Our God.

               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> The like arguments to Obedience we have in other Scriptures, to name but one to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Deut. 27.9, 10. <hi>Take heed and hearken O Iſrael, This day thou art become the people of the Lord thy God: Thou ſhalt therefore obey the voice of the Lord thy God, and do all his Commandments and ſtatutes, which I command thee this day.</hi> And that of <hi>Zacharias</hi> in his ſong, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75. urgeth the ſame Obedience upon us, upon account of our greater deliverance, <hi>That being delivered from the hands of our enemies, we ſhould ſerve Him without fear, in Holineſs and righteouſneſs all the days of our lives.</hi> Now I pray</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Atheiſm, or in the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. <hi>The Fools ſaying in his heart,</hi> much more ſpeaking it out in words, <hi>That there is no God.</hi> Polytheiſm, The having <hi>Lords many and Gods many, But to us</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. <hi>There is no more Gods but One.</hi> Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, not Glorifying, not worſhipping God, which is all one, as if we believed and profeſſed, There is no God.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104488:54"/>covetous and worldly minded men. From whence S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith expreſly, that <hi>covetouſneſs is idolatry,</hi> Col. 3.5. And he ſpeaks of ſome, who make <hi>their belly their God,</hi> Phil. 3.19. which do all Epicures, gluttons and drunkards, and intemperate perſons, and ſome (he ſaith,) <hi>mind earthly things.</hi> All theſe then are ſins againſt this firſt Commandment, which requires the Inward worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What doth the ſecond Commandment require?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Gods Outward worſhip, that is, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, not only with our hearts and Spirits, which God alone ſeeth, but alſo bodily, in the ſight of men, and not by I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, but as he himſelf appoints us in his word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> It is a marvellous thing, that there ſhould be any need of convincing men, that God is to be worſhipped Outwardly, as well as Inwardly, with our Bodies as well as with our Spirits, or that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of underſtanding, ſhould make that fooliſh uſe of our Saviours words to the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> John 4.24. <hi>God is a ſpirit, and is to be worſhipped in Spirit, and in truth,</hi> as if pretending to worſhip God in their hearts and ſpirits, could excuſe their utter neglect of his outward worſhip, or their not Kneeling in prayer, or any other irreverent, undecent behaving themſelves, in the worſhip of God. But if there be any need to ſpeak to this point, I think here is enough in the very letter of this Commandment to ſtop all mouths, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow down before images, and worſhip them.</hi> For in that, we muſt not do it <hi>before images,</hi> implies that <hi>before God</hi> we muſt do it, we muſt bow down before him, when we worſhip him; that as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. We may <hi>glorifie God with our bodies as well as with our spirits,</hi> which are his. Hence the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:104488:55"/>ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.7. <hi>We will go into his Tabernacle, and fall down before his footſtool.</hi> And hereunto are we daily invited in his words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.6. <hi>O come let us wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and fall down, and kneel before the Lord our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</hi> This muſt we do: only to avoid Superſtition and Will worſhip, we muſt have a care to do it in ſuch a manner, as God directs in his word, and not worſhip God in any way invented by man, contrary to his word. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. and 12.32. Whatſoever I command you, that obſerve and do, <hi>ye ſhall not add to the word I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh ought from it, that ye may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are thoſe kinds or parts of Worſhip which God himſelf hath appointed us in his word?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Daily Prayer, and Thankſgiving, often Reading, Hearing and Meditating upon His word, and the due Uſe of the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt,</hi> That Prayers and Thankſgivings are parts of Divine Worſhip, Unqueſtionedly commanded by God, is evident by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> direction to <hi>Timothy,</hi> as Provincial Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> 1 Ep. 2.1, 2. Which was to take order, that <hi>prayers, ſupplications and thanksgivings be made for all men, for Kings, and all in Authority,</hi> &amp;c. And how God ordained the publick reading of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures you may ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.11, 12. <hi>When all Iſrael is come to appear before the Lord, in the place which he ſhall chooſe, Then ſhalt thou read the Law before all Iſrael, in their hearing,</hi> &amp;c. And accordingly S. <hi>James,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſpake it in the Councel held there, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21. <hi>That Moſes had in every city, them that preacht him,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day. And if God appoints his word to be Read, it muſt needs be the peoples duty to hear the Reading, and <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.31. <hi>If they will not hear Moſes and the Prophets, neither would
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104488:55"/>they repent, though one ſhould rife from the dead.</hi> And to what purpoſe is it either to Read or Hear, if they do not Meditate on it, for as it is in the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Sower of the ſeed,</hi> Matth. 13.8. By this it is that <hi>the good ſeed takes root, and bringeth forth fruit.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that Meditates on Gods law day and night.</hi> As for the Holy Sacraments, Baptiſm, and the Supper of the Lord, you may ſee their Inſtitution at large, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the ſins forbidden in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Corrupting, neglecting, or hindring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ordinance of Right Worſhip: Idolatry, or Worſhipping Saints, Angels or Images, or God by Images: or Worſhipping God in any way contrary to, or not directed in his word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> If the Commandment require us to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, then muſt they neceſſarily be tranſgreſſors thereof, that come not to Church to joyn in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or are negligent in attending any Ordinance of Divine worſhip; as many do apparently, ſeldom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church at all, or coming after the prayers, and the reading of the Scriptures, as if it did not at all concern them, or that being here, behave themſelves moſt ſlovenly and irreverently in Gods Service: and then we muſt be ſure that we avoid all idolatry and falſe worſhip. For as it was charged upon Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Jews, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.4. <hi>Not to turn to Idols, nor to make any graven Images, nor to bow down to them, for</hi> this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> ſo is it alſo upon us of the Chriſtian Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Dearly beloved, flee from Idolatry.</hi> 1 John 5.21. <hi>Little Children, take heed of idols.</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>Whom do you think guilty of ſuch Idolatry?</hi>

                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:104488:57"/>Jews in worſhipping the Molten Calf, and Brazen Serpent; for they worſhip Saints, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Images, and adore the Croſs and the Hoſt, and have no better plea for ſo doing, but what might ſerve to excuſe, both Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Jews from being Idolaters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> In ſhort let me tell you, that Popiſh Idols or Images, having the like matter, and ſhapes, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, they do the ſame ſervice to them, and uſe the like pleas and pretences, as the Heathens did, and as the Idolatrous <hi>Jews</hi> did, and therefore are as truly I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters as they, and they that would ſee this fully proved, let them read the Churches Homilies of the peril of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How doth the Lord threaten all Idolaters, and Image worſhippers, and all Tranſgreſſors of this Commandment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Being jealous of his own glory, He will puniſh them as Haters of himſelf, nay them, and their ſeed after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> How jealous God is of his Glory, you may read, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 42.8. <hi>I am the Lord, That is my name, My Glory will I not give to another, neither my praiſe to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Images.</hi> And hence Idolatry is often in Scripture called, <hi>a ſpiritual whoredom, and adultery,</hi> which you know provokes any Husband to jealouſy and rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Wife. And here in this Commandment, it is expreſs, that God looks on them, as them that hate Him, who give his Worſhip to Images, or any others beſides Him, and he threatens to viſit their children after them, for this ſin to many generations.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Are the Proteſtants, and particularly we of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>clear from all Idolatry,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104488:57"/>in obſerving Ceremonies in Gods Worſhip, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly required in Gods Word?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: becauſe God hath left it in charge to Church Rulers, to appoint ſuch Ceremonies in his Worſhip, as conduce to Order, and Decency, and Edification, and being once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by our lawful Governors, We ought to obſerve them in Obedience to God, who requires us to obey our Governors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> It may ſuffice to tell you thus much upon this head, and you can by no means turn Diſſenters upon this account, if you remember this, That it is the Apoſtles direction, that all things in Gods Worſhip be done <hi>decently, and in order,</hi> and ſo as may conduce <hi>to Edification,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.26, 40. Which being the Duty and Province of the Churches Governours to take care of, (as they do at this day in all the Reformed Churches, and as they apparently did in the Primitive Churches,) it is very plain, that all private Chriſtians are to yield a ready Conformity, Submiſſion, and Obedience to their Orders and Canons, by a ſtrict Commandment, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Submit yourſelves to every Ordinance of man, for the Lords ſake.</hi> Heb. 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit yourſelves,</hi> &amp;c. And what ſaith our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle upon the matter? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16.

               <p>Q. <hi>What doth the third Commandment require?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It requires us to perform every part of Worſhip Devoutly to Gods Glory, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently to uſe every thing relating to God,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104488:58"/>as his Name, Titles, Ordinances, Houſe, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, Word and Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Will you hear the General Rule? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat, or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> If all our actions, much more then what we do in the Worſhip and Service of God, muſt be directed to His Glory, and therefore muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with the greateſt Reverence and Devotion, both of body and mind; to which purpoſe is that in the 29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1, 2. very memorable, <hi>Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty, Give unto the Lord, Glory and Strength, Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his Name,</hi> How? It follows, <hi>Worſhip the Lord in the Beauty of Holineſs,</hi> (in the Margent it is, in his Glorious Sanctuary.) As for the Name of God, To which the Glory is Due, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (by a Figure) is to be underſtood, not only God Himſelf, but alſo all that, whereby God is Known to us, or which hath a peculiar Relation to God, or which hath Gods Name upon it, or that is Gods, to all which we muſt in uſing them, ſhew the greateſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, not only to his Names, but alſo his Titles, Attributes, Ordinances, Houſes, Revenues, Words and Works.

               <p>Q. <hi>What then are the ſins forbidden in this Commandment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Unthankfullneſs, Diſtruſtfullneſs, not

               <p>Q. <hi>What doth God threaten them that thus tranſgreſs his Commandment?</hi>

                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> It cannot be expected that all duties and ſins herein required and forbidden, ſhould be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly named in ſo ſhort an Abſtract as a Catechiſm is, and ſhould be, but theſe are the chief.

And we are not to call upon any other but Him. Not Angels, for ſo the Angel forbad S. <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 22.9. <hi>See thou do it not, I am thy fellow ſervant.</hi> Not Saints, for <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 63.16. <hi>Abraham is ignorant of us, and Iſrael acknowledges us not.</hi> And as we are to put our whole truſt in God, ſo diſtruſtfulneſs was the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.19. <hi>Can God prepare a table in the wilderneſs?

To name but one or two, <hi>I will bring the Curſe, ſaith the Lord of hoſts by his Prophet Zechariah</hi> 5.4. <hi>and it ſhall enter into the houſe of him that ſweareth falſly by my Name, and ſhall remain in the midſt thereof, and conſume it with the Timber thereof, and with the ſtones thereof.</hi> And one Text in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.58, 59. may ſerve inſtead of all other Texts, <hi>If thou wilt not obſerve to fear this great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Name, The Lord thy God, Then will the Lord make thy plagues great, and wonderful, and the plagues of thy ſeed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and ſore ſickneſſes, and of long Continuance.</hi> In ſhort our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour explains this Commandment, to forbid, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perjury or falſe ſwearing, but alſo ſwearing vainly, and in our ordinary talk and Communication, and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by any other but God. For an Oath is a Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.33, 34, 37. <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf, But I ſay unto you, ſwear not at all, neither by heaven, nor by the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But let your Communications be yea, yea; nay, nay: for whatſoever is more than theſe, cometh of evil:</hi> and ſo much alſo of the third Commandment.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> We are aſſured both by Scripture and the Churches Hiſtories, that the Firſt day of the week was after Chriſts Reſurrection, and in memory thereof, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the Chriſtians for all the Holy Offices, as the Seventh day Sabbath, was by them under the old Teſtament, in memory of Gods Reſt from his works of Creation, and thence was it called the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. <hi>John in the Iſle of Patmos, was in the ſpirit on the Lords day.</hi> Act. 20.7. <hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>How muſt God be ſerved on thoſe days?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> The Commandment expreſsly forbids all ſervile works on the Sabbath day, and ſo do divers Texts, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13, 14. and 35.2. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.21. much more idleneſs, vain ſports and paſtimes, and all ſinful ſpending it in gluttony, drunkenneſs, <hi>filthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, and all manner of Licentiouſneſs.</hi> We are to reſt from our worldly labours, but mark for what end? not that bodily eaſe can of it ſelf pleaſe God, but it is, that being free from all encombrances of this world, and all earthly cares and diſtractions, we may ſanctifie the day, keep it holy, or hallow it. Only as our Saviour clears the matter in Confutation of the Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.11, 12, 13. Works of Neceſſity, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Charity are allowed and lawful; for <hi>What man of you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>having an Ox or an Aſs fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a pit on the ſabbath day, will not lift it up?</hi> It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full therefore to do good on the Sabbath day.

               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> The Tenour of the Commandment runs thus, <hi>Thou and thy Son, and thy daughter, thy man ſervant, thy maid ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. And for an example to all Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, as well as Kings and Princes, <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaid,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104488:61"/>chap. 24.15. <hi>As for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> So let all of us ſay, Let other perſons be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs how their families obſerve the Lords day, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they come to the Church, or be abſent, how they miſpend it in vain ſports or prophaneſs, I and mine will do otherwiſe, we will ſerve the Lord publickly and privately with all good care and Conſcience, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 42.4. <hi>We will go up together unto the houſe of God, with the voice of joy and praiſe, with the multitude that keep holy day.</hi> Pſal. 101.4, 6. <hi>A froward heart ſhall depart from me: I will not know a wicked perſon.

                  <hi>A.</hi> His allowing us ſix days for our own labours, and his own ſpecial property in the Seventh, His own Example, and His having Sanctified the Sabbath day to Holy Uſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Every one is able of himſelf to diſcern all theſe in the words of the Commandment. Let me then leave that to you, and ask you in the next place.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is it ſufficient to ſerve God in his Solemn days only?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: We muſt ſet apart ſome Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent part of our time every day, and ſerve him truly all the days of our lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> We are injoyned in Gods word, <hi>to pray always,</hi> Luk. 18.1. <hi>and to pray without ceaſing,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.17. that is, keep a conſtant daily courſe of prayer. And in all things <hi>to give thanks,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.18. and to have <hi>God always before us,</hi> Pſ. 16.8. So is every day to be ſo a Sabbath unto us, as therein to reſt from ſin, and to allot ſome competent time for Gods immediate ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104488:61"/>from our worldly buſineſs, as well as to ſerve him by all diligence in labour, and by faithful and righteous dealing in our Callings and Vocations, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered from the hands of our enemies,</hi> it is that <hi>we may ſerve him without fear, in Holineſs and righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him all the days of our lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Doth this fourth Commandment then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us Chriſtians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: though not the Ceremonial part, as it requires the ſeventh-day Sabbath, and the ſtrict Jewiſh Reſt, yet what is of Moral equity in it, to wit, that a Competent part of our time be thus devoted to Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> It concerns us, even us Chriſtians to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member often Gods fearful judgements, on divers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning of the Sabbath, as him that <hi>gathered ſticks on it,</hi> Num. 15.32. and them that <hi>bare burdens on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day in Jeruſalem,</hi> Jer. 17.27. And <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> zeal to reſtrain from <hi>buying and ſelling wares on the Sabbath day,</hi> chap. 10.31. againſt thoſe that <hi>trode the winepreſſes, and brought in ſheaves and aſſes laden with wine, grapes, and figs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>on the Sabbath day,</hi> chap. 13. from ver. 15. to 23. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 11. <hi>Theſe examples are written for our learning or admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> And as God gave Ten Commandments, ſo had this in ſpecial, the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Lawgiver, as the other had, even the Eternal God, the Creator of all things, who (as the very light of nature prompts) if he be God, muſt be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and glorified as God; which cannot be, unleſs ſome competent portion of time, (ſuppoſe one in ſeven) be ſet apart for it. And therefore although the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial part of the Commandment be abrogated, yet is the Moral ſtill Obligatory to us Chriſtians. And
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104488:62"/>ſo our Holy Church believes, or elſe we ſhould not be taught by it to pray after the reading of this, as well as every other Commandment, Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this Law.</p>
               <p>I may now hope you pretty well underſtand your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards God, taught you in the firſt Table of the Decalogue, the four firſt Commandments. Let us go on then to the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How many Commandments are there in the ſecond Table?</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> My duties towards my Neighbour.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is your duty to your Neighbour. Rehearſe it out of the Church-Catechiſm.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> My duty to my Neighbour, is to love him as my ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> In this Anſwer you have, firſt your whole duty to your Neighbour ſummed up in a few words, and then ſet before you in its ſeveral branches, as the particular precepts of Gods law require them. I pray then firſt,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the ſumm of your duties towards your Neighbour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To love my Neighbour as my ſelf, and to ſhew that love, by doing to all men, as I would they ſhould do unto me.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May I not do to others, as they do unto me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: but as I would they ſhould do unto me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> That to love my Neighbour as my ſelf, is the ſumm and ſubſtance of the Six laſt Commandments,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104488:62"/>and ſo of all the duties we owe him, appears by, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.9. <hi>For this,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhalt not ſteal, Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs, Thou ſhalt not co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>nded in this ſaying, Thou ſhalt Love thy Neighbour, as thy ſelf.</hi> For we muſt manifeſt our loving him as our ſelves, by doing <hi>to all as we would they ſhould do unto us:</hi> And whoſoever doth ſo, he cannot do any act of injury, or wrong, or injuſtice to any perſon, forbidden by any of theſe Commandments. If a man indeed do to others, as others do unto him, This is Revenge, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but do them wrong, as, or becauſe they injure him. But he that doth to others, as he would have others to do to himſelf in the like caſe, This man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deal unjuſtly, or uncharitably with any perſon, in any cauſe or matter. He will neither fail of doing his duty to his Superiors, Inferiours, nor Equals, againſt the fifth Commandment, becauſe were he in their place and ſtation, he would expect ſuch duty from them to himſelf. He will neither wrong any perſon in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, perſon, Goods, or good name, againſt the other Commandments, becauſe he would by no means have them ſo to wrong himſelf in the like caſe. So this is a Comprehenſive Law, containing all others in it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of juſtice or charity, all the Six laſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Let us now caſt our eyes upon every of them apart One by one.</p>

                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> My good children, Theſe are great Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and very proper for you to learn, and have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care to practice; for our Relative duties have a moſt conſiderable place in true Religion, and no man can be ſaid to be truly Religious, that makes no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a careful performing them. For further un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding whereof, Let me acquaint you in the firſt place, That the great thing required in this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is in other words S. <hi>Pauls</hi> precept, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Render therefore to all their Dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, cuſtome to whom cuſtom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour,</hi> Owe no man any thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, Children muſt love their parents, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural parents, their Father and Mother. And that this is included in the word (honour) as belonging to parents, is evident by the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> oppoſing that honour which is due to fathers, to that fear which belongs to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants towards their Maſters, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>A Son honours his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a ſervant his Maſter, If I then be a father, where is my honour? and if I be a Maſter, where is my fear?</hi> And the love children owe to their parents is not denied, but implied in that of our Saviour, when it interferes not with our duty to God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother, more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> (2) Children muſt honour their parents, which you ſee is the letter of the Commandment, that is, have a high and reverend eſteem of them in their hearts. (3) They muſt ſuccour them, that is, in caſe of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104488:63"/>want, old age or ſickneſs, relieving their wants and helping their Infirmities, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.4. <hi>If any widow have children or nephews, Let them learn to ſhew piety at home, and to requite their parents. For this is good, and acceptable to God.</hi> And in a word, which is the reſult of all, they muſt obey them in all their lawful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and fulfil them, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Children obey your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in all things, for this is well pleaſing to God.</hi> Now beſides natural parents, there are civil and political parents, the Fathers of our Country, the King, and ſuch as are in Authority under him; and there are Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual parents, Governours, Teachers, Spiritual paſtors, and Maſters; and all our Betters, in Age, or quality, or eſtate, have a ſort of parental Relation to us, and ſo all theſe are included in the words <hi>(Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)</hi> in the Commandment. For Subjects then, their duty is to honour the King, and all that repreſent the King, in their reſpective places, and offices, all that are in Authority under him; to honour them for his ſake, as bearing his Authority. And this Honouring the King is ſo neceſſary, that God joyns theſe two together in one precept, as if we could not do the one aright, without the other, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.21. <hi>My Son, fear thou the Lord, and the King, and meddle not with them, that are given to change.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.17. <hi>Fear God, Honour the King.</hi> And this Honouring him in our hearts, muſt be ſhown by obeying their good Laws in our Actions, whether concerning our manners, or concerning their tributes and prerogatives. For ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf teacheth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Render to Caeſar the things which are Caeſars, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the things which are Gods.</hi> Rom. 13.1. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the Higher powers,</hi> &amp;c.

And ſo S. <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſoever his pretended Succeſſors the Pope and Prieſts of <hi>Rome</hi> teach, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every ordinance of man, for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the King, as ſupreme: or unto Governours, as unto them that are ſent by Him, for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well.</hi> As for Governours, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Spiritual paſtors, to them, the Catechiſm ſaith, is due the peoples ſubmiſſion. One Text is ſufficient to prove it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit yourſelves: for they watch for your Souls, as they that muſt give an account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for you.</hi> And ſo muſt ſervants obey, and ſubmit to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, in all lawful commands, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Servants be ſubject to your Maſters, without fear, not only the gentle, but alſo the froward.</hi> And laſtly, All men muſt behave themſelves lowly and reverently to all their betters, in age, eſtate, or quality, them that be elder, either in higher Rank or Condition. For this it is that will preſerve order, peace and good will amongſt men. And I ſhall only here give you the Text, for reverencing the aged, even in Gods own Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.32. <hi>Thou ſhalt riſe up to the hoary head, and honour the old man. I am the Lord.</hi>

               <p>Many more Texts might I have cited for each duty to theſe Relations, but for brevities ſake, I muſt let theſe ſuffice, beſeeching you to let them ſink and root in your hearts, for the regulating your whole converſations in this world.</p>

                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> To prove which I need no more but ſhew what the Apoſtle requires of either of them, for that ſhews their reſpective tranſgreſſions, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Wives ſubmit yourſelves to your husbands, as it is fit in the Lord,</hi> and mark his reaſon, <hi>for the Husband is the Head of the wife, as Chriſt is the Head of his Church.</hi> Ver. 33. <hi>Let the wife therefore ſee that ſhe reverence her husband.</hi> For quiet and unquiet behavior, what St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for this Sex to be often thinking of, 1 Ep. 3.4. Commending to them, <hi>a meek and, quiet ſpirit,</hi> as the beſt ornament, far to be preferred before thoſe of <hi>gold, ſilver</hi> or <hi>pearl,</hi> it being <hi>in the ſight of God of great price.</hi> As for Unfaithfulneſs, that is of two ſorts, that in his bed, which is Adultery, and that in ſuch concerns as are committed to them, by their husbands. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which I ſhall need ſay no more, but offer you that deſcription the <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> gives of a good wife, and then it will follow, unfaithfulneſs muſt needs be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a bad one, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.11. <hi>The Heart of her buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſafely truſts in her, ſo that he ſhall have no need to fear spoil, or waſte.</hi>

               <p>On the other hand, there are like ſins of husbands towards their wives, unfaithfulneſs, and any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to true love, eſpecially unkindneſs, or bitterneſs of anger. For <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.28. <hi>They ought to love their wives, as their own bodies, and as Chriſt loved the Church.</hi> Col. 3.19. <hi>Husbands love your wives, and be not bitter againſt them.</hi> Not providing for their Comfortable Suſtenance.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104488:67"/>the forequoted cenſure of the Apoſtle, <hi>He that provides not for them of his own houſehold, is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> And laſtly it is expreſsly injoyned them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Likewiſe ye husbands, dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honour unto the Wife,</hi> and ſo bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her infirmities, <hi>as the weaker veſſel, and as heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindred.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All proud or irreverent behaviour towards them, whether in word or deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> In all degrees of men, The Lord hateth a <hi>proud look,</hi> as well as a <hi>lying tongue,</hi> Prov. 6.17. The younger ſort therefore are to be <hi>humble and ſober minded,</hi> Tit. 2.6. And it is Gods expreſs Law, that they <hi>riſe up before the hoary head, and bonour the old man,</hi> with this reaſon, <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> Lev. 19.32. And as for the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer and richer ſort, their Wealth and Wiſdom being the Bleſſings of God, uſeful to the good of mankind, there is a reverence due to them, whence <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the forequoted place forbids, as <hi>curſing the King in our thoughts,</hi> ſo <hi>the rich in our bed-chamber, for a bird of the air ſhall carry the voice, and that which hath wings, will tell the matter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> For as for the Aged, it is diſcretion that makes the gray hairs truly venerable.

               <p>Q. <hi>What doth God promiſe to them that keep, and threaten to them that tranſgreſs this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> It is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> obſervation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.2. that <hi>this is the firſt Commandment with promiſe,</hi> that is, the firſt of thoſe that ſhew our duties towards men, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an expreſs promiſe of long life annexed to it: and in this promiſe is implied a threatning to all diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient Children, and ſo to all other tranſgreſſors of this Law, of ſhortning their days, and cutting them off as an ear of corn untimely, before it be ripe. And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially let the <hi>Wiſe mans</hi> Comminations againſt all Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Subjects, be in our remembrance always, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.21. <hi>My Son, fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change.</hi> For who knows the deſtruction of them both, both the ringleaders and their followers? And for all other ſinners againſt this Commandment in ſpecial, Memorable is that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.27. <hi>The fear of the Lord prolongeth days, but the years of the wicked ſhall be ſhortned.</hi> So have you a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perent account of the duties required, and the ſins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the fifth Commandment: and let it be all our prayer always, Lord have mercy upon us, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our paſt tranſgreſſions, and henceforth, and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver encline our hearts to keep this Law.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> All lawful endeavours to preſerve mine own life, and the lives of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Therefore muſt we, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>do good to all men,</hi> that is, towards preſerving their lives or rendring them more Comfortable.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All lawful endeavours to further my Neighbours Wealth, as well as mine own.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How doth your Catechiſm expreſs this?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To be true and juſt in all my dealings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> This Commandment enjoyns you juſt, and plain, and honeſt dealing with all men. For <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8. <hi>What doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to do juſtly, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God?</hi> And without this, let no man think he can be ſaved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.1, 2. <hi>Who ſhall dwell in thine Holy hill? He that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth uprightly, and worketh righteouſneſs, and doth no ill to his Neighbour.</hi> For in this ſaith S. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Ep. 3.10. <hi>In this are the Children of God manifeſt, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil: He that doth not righteouſneſs is not of God, neither he that Hateth his Brother.</hi> But then I pray,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>In what Commandment are Alms, and works of Mercy and Charity required?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Both in this, and in the Sixth Commandment: In this Commandment; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Almſgiving is a work of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, as well as of Charity: it is the poor Mans due. And in the Sixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; for we are guilty of his Blood,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104488:71"/>who periſhed for want, when we are able to relieve him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> This is excellently illuſtrated in a paſſage of the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> Ecclus. 4.1. <hi>My Son, defraud not the poor of his Living; neither make the needy to wait long; Make not the hungry Soul ſorrowful, and defer not to give to him that is in need,</hi> chap. 34.25. The Bread of the needy is his Life, He that defraudeth a man thereof, is a man of Blood. He that takes away his Neighbours living, ſlayeth him; and he that defrauds his Labourer of his hire, is a blood-ſhedder. This is plain, we muſt be charitable to relieve men in extreme need, or elſe we are guilty of injuſtice and fraud; defrauding the poor of his Living; and we are guilty of blood, for not relieving Him, that is ready to ſtarve for extreme want, we do in effect ſlay or kill him. And for Alms being required by this Commandment (Thou ſhalt not ſteal) Hear a greater than the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> even <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> in his <hi>Proverbs</hi> 3.27. <hi>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</hi> In a word, A man cannot be Uncharitable but he is withall Unjuſt and Unrighteous. For the Rich man is Gods Steward, his riches are his Talent to be employed for his glory and others good, and his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity are the poor mans Due, if need require, what he hath to ſpare is due unto him, to do him good by Gods Ordinance and Commandment.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What then are the ſins forbidden by this Commandment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All picking and ſtealing; that is, All acts of Fraud and Oppreſſion, as well as Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is required of thoſe who have thus wronged others, in any kind or degree, that they may be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:104488:71"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Reſtitution to their power: For he is Unjuſt, and a Thief in Gods account, who witholds what is another mans, being able to reſtore it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> It is not for nothing, that your Catechiſm thus teacheth you diſtinctly and expreſsly, both the Affirmative and Negative, both the duties enjoyned, and the ſins forbidden in this Commandment, more then in the other Commandments. It is becauſe juſt and honeſt dealing, carry a great place and figure in true Religion, and no Unjuſt man can be truly Holy and Religious before God, whatever he pretends.</p>
               <p>Now know that the Letter of this Commandment forbids Stealing, that is, all acts of Violence, or Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery; and other Scriptures manifeſtly extend the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all Acts of Fraud, Falſhood, Guile and Oppreſſion, and make them degrees of Theft, what ſofter notions ſoever the world may have of them. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Ye ſhall not ſteal, nor deal falſly, nor lie one to another.</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt not defraud thy Neighbour, nor rob him.</hi> And chap 25.17. <hi>Ye ſhall not oppreſs one another</hi> (that is, by over, or undervaluing what ye Buy or Sell) <hi>I am the Lord.</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.6. <hi>Let no man defraud, or go beyond his brother in any thing; for God is the Avenger of all ſuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if any one have done any of theſe things, then muſt he of neceſſity reſtore to every one, what he hath wronged him of, if ever he hopes to be ſaved. The Holy Fathers of the Church, give it as a certain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non or Rule, that without this Reſtitution, there can be no Remiſſion, no Salvation, And with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for God ſaith in his Law expreſsly, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.4. <hi>He that hath ſinned and is guilty, He ſhall reſtore that which he hath taken violently away, or the thing which he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deceitfully, or all that, about which, being delivered him to keep, or being loſt he found, or for whatſoever he ſwear falſely, He ſhall reſtore it, even in the principal, and ſhall
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104488:72"/>add a fifth part more, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth in the day of his treſpaſs offering.</hi> Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of which Reſtitution we have one in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13.

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: They are Thieves to their Families, who either provide not for them, or ſpend all they have upon their Luſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> I have before told you of the Apoſtles moſt ſevere Cenſure of ſuch men as are careleſs of their Families. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. <hi>If any man provide not for them of his own houſehold, He hath denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> And I appeal to every one here, if it be not the ſame caſe; for a man vainly to waſt what ſhould maintain his wife and children, and piſs that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the walls, which ſhould be bread and clothing to their backs and bellies.

This is expreſly forbidden in the Letter of this Commandment. But I pray learn further, it is not only lying and falſe ſpeaking, that you muſt avoid by this Commandment, but alſo all evilſpeaking as your Catechiſm teacheth you. <hi>Put them in mind</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1, 2. and in him to all Miniſters) <hi>to ſpeak evil of no man, to be no brawlers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Not rendring evil for evil, or railing for railing,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Peter.</hi> 1 Ep. 3.9.

St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore joyns theſe together, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Envy, ſtrife, railings, evil ſurmiſings, as coming from pride and ſtrife of words.</hi> So is evil ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſings a great fault, and from thence, raſh judging and cenſuring. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.1, 2. <hi>Judge not, that you be not judged; for with what meaſure thou meteſt out to another, it ſhall be meaſured to thee again.</hi> And S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, chap. 4.11. <hi>Speak not evil one of another (brethren) He that ſpeaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, speaketh evil of the Law, and judgeth the Law.</hi> To this may be added talebearing, a thing expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God himſelf in his Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.16. <hi>Thou
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104488:73"/>ſhalt not go up and down as a talebearer, among my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> A thing <hi>Solomon</hi> often declaims againſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.8. <hi>The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and go down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inner parts of the belly.</hi> Chap. 11.13. <hi>A talebearer revealeth ſecrets, but he that is of a faithful ſpirit, conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the matter.</hi> And therefore he imputeth the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of ſtrife among men to theſe, chap. 26.20. <hi>Where there is no wood, there the fire goeth out: ſo where there is no talebearer the ſtrife ceaſeth.</hi> And by Conſequence where ſuch are it continueth. It is therefore excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent councel which the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> gives, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Whether it be to friend or foe, talk not of other mens lives: and if thou canſt without offence reveal them not,</hi> look the place at large, and alſo chap. 21.25, 26. In ſhort I exhort you Beloved, often to read what S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith at large in his Epiſtle of the Government of the tongue, that unruly member, and always to remember and carry in your minds the Rule S. <hi>Peter</hi> 1 Ep. 3.10. gives out of the 34. <hi>Pſalm</hi> ver. 12. <hi>What man is he that deſires life, and to ſee good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile. Let him eſchew evil, and do good: let him ſeek peace and enſue it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May we in no Caſe tell a lye, no not for the better?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for all lies are of the Devil, and we muſt not do evil that good may come of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> That all lyes are of the Devil, is plain by what Chriſt ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. <hi>When the Devil speaks a lye, he speaks of his own, For he is a Lyer, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lyes.</hi> And as for Officious lyes, that is, lyes for the better (as we commonly ſay) S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Rule to Chriſtians condemns them ſufficiently, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 8. <hi>No man may do evil, that good may come of it.</hi> For they that do ſo, <hi>their Damnation is juſt.</hi> Now have you but one
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104488:74"/>Commandment remaining, which moſt Divines expound to deſign chiefly the regulating the very heart, and ſo to have influence upon all the reſt, which reſtrain the hands, and tongue, and outward man from all acts of Injuſtice and Unrighteouſneſs, but let us learn what your Catechiſm teaches you of it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What duties doth the Tenth Commandment require of you, according to your Catechiſm?</hi> (<hi>Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Labour and diligence in my Calling, that I may get mine own Living; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; doing my duty in that ſtate of life unto which it hath pleaſed God to call me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> If any man be idle, and will not labour, S. <hi>Paul</hi> cenſures him to hunger, ſaying, <hi>neither let him eat,</hi> 1 Theſ. 3.10. For ſuch a man croſſeth Gods Ordinance, who as it is in <hi>Job</hi> 5.27. <hi>made man to labour, as the ſparks to fly upward.</hi> Such is therefore Gods Canon-law, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. <hi>Let him that ſtole, ſteal no more; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let him labour with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</hi> And as for diligence in this labour, we know what God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and may daily ſee how God proſpers it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. <hi>He becometh poor that dealeth with a ſlack hand, But the hand of the diligent maketh rich.</hi> Chap. 13.4. <hi>The Soul of the ſluggard deſireth, and hath nothing, but the Soul of the diligent ſhall be made fat.</hi> Now being diligent and induſtrious in our Callings; we muſt be content with that Condition and State of life, wherein God hath placed us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. For Godlineſs with Contentment is great gain. Let your Converſation therefore be without Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſnes.</hi> Heb. 13.5. <hi>And be content with ſuch things as ye have: for he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> And herein we have the Apoſtle for an
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104488:74"/>excellent example, who ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11. <hi>I have learnt to abound and to ſuffer want, and in whatſoever Eſtate I am, therewith to be content.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What then are the ſins forbidden by this Commandment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Idleneſs in my Calling, Diſcontent with my preſent Condition, Envying, Coveting or inordinate deſiring the Goods of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Hear a little out of the Scriptures of each of theſe. The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 1.6.49. tells you what the ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> was, <hi>even fulneſs of bread, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Idleneſs.</hi> And as <hi>Solomon</hi> often inveighs againſt the ſluggard, ſo his Cenſure of this vice (to name no more) methinks deſerves your good remmembrance, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.18. <hi>By much ſlothfulneſs the Building decayeth, and through Idleneſs of the hands, the Houſe droppeth through.</hi> As for Diſcontentment in whatever Condition Gods providence placeth us, it is quite contrary to Holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> reſolves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9. <hi>I will lay my hand upon my mouth, and ſay nothing, becauſe it is thy Doing.</hi> And to <hi>Jobs</hi> carriage under his unſpeakable loſſes and croſſes. For when all was deſtroyed, and he fell into moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme poverty and miſery, He ſinned not, but ſaid, chap. 1 21. <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> And to his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring wife he ſaid, chap. 2.10. <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt like one of the fooliſh women, for ſhall we receive good, and not evil at the hands of the Lord?</hi> And now, as we muſt not be diſcontent with, nor impatient under our own Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo muſt we not envy at another mans. For En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings are numbred amongſt the <hi>works of the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.21. And the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Charity envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, but rejoyceth in others good.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cautions every godly man againſt envying, fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at even the wicked mans proſperity in this world. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 37. throughout. And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104488:75"/>
                  <hi>Let us walk, not in ſtrife nor envying,</hi> no more than <hi>in gluttony and drunkenneſs;</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> makes envy the Fountain of many miſchiefs, ſaying, chap. 3.16. <hi>Where envying is there is Confuſion, and every evil work.</hi> And laſtly, as for Coveting and inordinate deſire of others goods, The letter of the Commandment expreſsly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbours houſe,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore I ſay in the words of the Prophet, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 33.31. <hi>Let not your hearts go after your Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> So have you now all the Commandments ſet before you, by which I exhort you often to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine yourſelves, how your eſtate ſtands towards God, and concerning your hopes of Salvation, and great cauſe have we all to ſay as Holy Church directs us, after the repeating them in the Communion Service, and that even from the bottom of our hearts, Lord have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to pardon us all our Omiſſions and Commiſſions therein, and for the time to Come, write all theſe Laws in our hearts. So proceed we to the next Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Head in Catechiſm.</p>

               <head>The Lords Prayer: for an Introduction whereto, I ask you,</head>
               <p>Q. <hi>My Good Child, Doſt thou think thou art able to do theſe things of thy ſelf, or to keep theſe Commandments of God, or to ſerve him of thy ſelf, by any natural power of thine own?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What then is needful to enable thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Gods ſpecial Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> I have minded you before, of what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 11.15. <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the branches, He that abideth in me, and I in him,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104488:75"/>bringeth forth much fruit, for without me ye can do nothing,</hi> Joh. 15.5. it is God that worketh in us both to will and do that which is good. And thence are we able <hi>to do all things,</hi> Phil. 4.13. any good thing <hi>through Chriſt ſtrengthening us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why are you unable to keep Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, or to ſerve him without this ſpecial Grace aſſiſting you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe my duties are Spiritual, and having many mighty Enemies, and ſtrong Temptations, I am by nature prone to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and averſe from all good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> I have before upon the fourth Queſtion in Catechiſm, and in the Creed inſtructed you in this your natural Corruption, and I cannot do it too often, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks much of it in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. ſaying, <hi>In me,</hi> that is, in my fleſh <hi>dwelleth no good thing.</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>For to will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good I know not.</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>What I would, that I do not: but what I hate, that do I.</hi> Our Enemies they are mighty, and very ſubtile, even the Devil, the world and the fleſh. Our duties are ſpiritual: for God ſaith, <hi>My Son, Give me thy heart,</hi> Prov. 23.26. and will be worſhipped <hi>in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> Joh. 4.24. But we are <hi>carnal, ſold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſin,</hi> Rom. 7.14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>By what means then may you obtain Gods ſpecial Grace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By diligent, that is, by daily fervent prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Of the efficacy of our prayers to obtain Gods ſpecial Grace Our Saviour aſſures us, and that by way of Argument, which gives us much ſtronger conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Luk,</hi> 11.13. <hi>If ye being evil, know how to give good
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104488:76"/>gifts to your Children, how much more will your heavenly Father give his Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> But then Our asking muſt be thus qualified, that it may obtain: it muſt be daily, we muſt <hi>pray continually or without ceaſing,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.17. <hi>and fervently,</hi> Jam. 5.16. <hi>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. Ask therefore,</hi> and ſo ask, <hi>and it ſhall be given you: ſeek and ye ſhall find: knock and it ſhall be opened unto you,</hi> Matth. 7.7.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>In what bodily poſture muſt you pray?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Kneeling, or at leaſt with the greateſt reverence poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> For in this poſture of kneeling have Gods Saints always made their ſolemn prayers, or for the moſt part. And as we cannot uſe too much reverence in our Addreſſes to ſo great a God, ſo unto this are we daily invited in the words of the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.6. <hi>O come let us worſhip and fall down, and kneel before the Lord our maker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What things muſt you pray for beſides Gods Grace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Only for things agreeable to Gods will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> 1 Joh. 5.14. <hi>This is the Confidence that we have in him, that whatever we ask according to his Will, he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>In whoſe Name and Mediation muſt we put up our prayers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Neither of Saints nor Angels, but only that of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> So he himſelf directs us. For <hi>he the is one Mediator betwixt us and the one God,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. Therefore he ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14 13.14. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in me. If ye ſhall ask any thing in my Name, I will do it.</hi> And he aſſures us, even with an Oath, that his Father will do
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104488:76"/>it, chap. 16.23. <hi>Verily, Verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you.</hi> And he ſeems to ſolve the doubt, why he ſaith, he will do it, and his Father will do it too, ver. 26. <hi>Ye ſhall ask in my Name, and I ſay unto you, that I will pray the father for you,</hi> &amp;c. For <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave to the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt, ſeeing he liveth for ever to make interceſſion for us.</hi> With great reaſon therefore doth our Holy Church conclude all her prayers with theſe words, <hi>Through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> And praying in Chriſts Name, we cannot pray better or more acceptably than in his words too.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Which is the beſt form of prayer, and moſt perfect pattern to direct you in praying?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Prayer Chriſt taught his Diſciples, called, The Lords Prayer.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Let me hear you then ſay the Lords prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Our Father which art in heaven, Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed be thy name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> It is rightly called the Lords prayer, as the Euchariſt is called the Lords Supper, becauſe he compoſed it, as he inſtituted and ordained this his Supper. Now obſerve when Chriſt taught his Diſciples this prayer; it is ſaid in <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2. <hi>When ye pray, ſay,</hi> plainly making it Our duty (as his Diſciples, as we will owne ourſelves to be Chriſtians) to uſe this form of prayer at all times; for it is a moſt perfect and Comprehenſive prayer, containing all that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be prayed for, and therefore ſupplying the defects of all other our prayers. But at another time, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9. He ſaid, <hi>After this manner pray ye,</hi> as plainly there making it a pattern to all other our prayers. And ſo doing, Our prayers cannot be other than according to Gods will, and being ſo, we are ſure he will hear and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104488:77"/>grant our petitions. Now tell me what your Catechiſm teacheth you of this.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What deſireſt thou of God in this prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I deſire my Lord God, our Heavenly Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> This is a very ſolid anſwer, and teacheth you a great deal in a little Compaſs. My part is to help you to underſtand to what part and petition of your Lords prayer, every clauſe in this anſwer is to be referred, and to make theſe and all other needful things concerning it as plain as I can. In the mean time, Let me give you this inſtruction. It will be very good and profitable for you, (Good Children,) to get ſome other good and godly prayers by heart for your dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe, out of ſome or other good books, ſuch as thoſe ſometimes annexed to your Bibles, or thoſe in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Book called, <hi>The Whole duty of man,</hi> or the like. And till you can do that, let me tell you, you may make a very good prayer of this your anſwer, and uſing it devoutly and with underſtanding, it will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God. Inſtead of ſaying, I deſire my Lord God, Our heavenly Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is but altering it thus, and it will be a very good prayer. O Lord God, Our Heavenly Father, who art the Author of all goodneſs, I deſire thee, I beſeech thee, that thou wilt ſend thy grace to me and to all people, that we may worſhip thee, ſerve thee, and obey thee as we ought to do, and I pray unto thee that thou wilt ſend us all things, that be needful both for our bodies and our Souls, and that thou wilt be merciful unto us, and, forgive us our ſins, and I humbly beg that it will pleaſe thee to ſave us in all dangers Ghoſtly and bodily, and that thou wilt keep us from all ſin and wickedneſs, and from our Ghoſtly Enemy, and from Everlaſting death. And I truſt and beg of thee, that I may always truſt that thou

               </p>
               <p>Say this your anſwer in ſuch a form of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Now for our further underſtanding of our Lords pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and of this account your Catechiſm gives of it, I ask you,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How many parts are there in the Lords prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Three: a Preface, the Petitions, and the Doxology or Concluſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> See what you may learn by the Preface firſt.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>To whom muſt you pray that you may be ſure to ſpeed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To our Father in Heaven only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> A very neceſſary Obſervation, ſince we know the Papiſts practices of making their prayers, to Saints and Angels, nay to very Images, and eſpecially to the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Which if any Chriſtians can law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do, it is marvellous that our Lord and Saviour ſhould direct us ſo ſtrictly to pray to God, and him only, to no other whom we cannot call by this title, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven.</hi> Religious prayer and Invocation is a Divine Honour, it is proper to God, who ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble,</hi> and we cannot give Gods glory to another without the guilt of Idolatry. To pray unto Saints or Angels, implies an adoring them, as Omnipotent, able to help us, Omnipreſent; and Omniſcient, capable of hearing us wherever, and whenſoever we call upon them. And can
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104488:78"/>we he ſure of either of theſe? or are they poſſible? where have we any precept or direction in all the Scriptures, to make our Addreſſes and Supplications un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them? or any example of any Saints that have done it before us? or any promiſe of their hearing our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or helping our neceſſities, or of our obtaining what we ask of them, or by their Mediation? And having none of theſe, how can we pray to them in duty or in Faith? But this we can do to God, and to him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Our Father which is in Heaven.</hi> For being Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is gracious and of great kindneſs, having Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly bowels, ready and willing to hear and help us, and being <hi>Our Father in Heaven.</hi> He is Almighty, the Great giver of all goodneſs, and therefore able to hear and help us. And therefore to him alone let us make our <hi>prayers and ſupplications</hi> ſaying, with Holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 25.1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my Soul.</hi> Pſal. 121.1, 2. <hi>I will lift up mine eyes to the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord who made Heaven and Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the meaning then of this Preface</hi> (Our Father which art in Heaven?)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It teaches me to call upon God, as my Lord God, Our Heavenly Father, who is the Giver of all Goodneſs, and ſo aſſures me that he both will, and can hear and help me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Your Catechiſm here, gives you a very ſhort but pithy explanation of this Title of the Great God, as the <hi>Hearer of prayers,</hi> Pſal. 65.2. <hi>(Our Father which art in Heaven.)</hi> Therein every one calls upon God in ſuch words, as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> expreſſeth his faith in, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.28. <hi>My Lord and my God.</hi> Thou, in whom I have a ſpecial intereſt as my God. Yet (mark it) not ſo mine, but that he is alſo others. <hi>(Our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.)</hi> For I am in Charity to look upon others as
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104488:78"/>my Brethren, having a filial relation alſo to God, as well as my ſelf. Now (as I ſaid) in that <hi>He is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> This aſſures us that he is ready and willing to hear and help us, as any Father will do for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for ſo Chriſt argues, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.9, 10. <hi>If a child ask bread of his father, will he give him a ſtone? or if he ask a fiſh, will he give him a Scorpien?</hi> Will he not give him all good things, and things needful and profitable for him? <hi>Hon much more will</hi> God as a Father <hi>give us all good things that we ask him?</hi> For <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13. <hi>As a Father pitieth his children, ſo doth the Lord them that fear him.</hi> And then that he is Our Heavenly Father, this aſſures us of his power and ability, that he can help us. For <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.1. <hi>The Lord is great in Sion, and he is high above all people.</hi> Pſal. 97.1. <hi>The Lord reigneth, let his Children rejoyce.</hi> For nothing then can harm them without his leave and providence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1. Even when <hi>the Heathen rage, and the Kings of the Earth bandy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, againſt the Lord, and againſt his Anointed, he that ſetteth in Heaven ſhall laugh them to ſcorn. The Lord ſhall have them in Deriſion.</hi> He that dwells in Heaven. Pray, how dwells the Lord there? Surely not ſo there, but that he is in all places, Omnipreſent, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.23. <hi>Am I God at hand, and not afar of, ſaith the Lord? Do not I fill heaven and Earth, ſaith the Lord?</hi> But he is in Heaven, becauſe there is the Habitation of <hi>His throne of Majeſty,</hi> Pſal. 97.2. And there and from thence he more eſpecially manifeſteth his exceeding great power and glory. So is he Our Father in heaven in that ſence, and as our Catechiſm adds by way of expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, He is therefore the Giver of all Goodneſs, <hi>of all good things,</hi> Jam. 1.17. <hi>Every good and every perfect gift comes from above, even from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableneſs neither ſhaddow of turning.</hi> So much of the Preface, now to the petitions.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How many petitions are there in the Lords prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:104488:79"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Six: Three with relation to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and three to our own benefit.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why are we taught to pray firſt for what reſpects Gods Glory, before we pray for things relating to our own benefit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To teach us that we ought to make Gods Glory the great end of our prayers, as well as of all our Actions; and in all caſes, to prefer it before all things whatſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Gods glory is the great end of our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and of whatever God doth, <hi>that the whole Earth may be full of his Glory,</hi> Iſaiah 6.3. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>The Lord made all things for himſelf, yea, even the wicked for the day of evil,</hi> that is, to glorifie his juſtice in them. Now what is Gods end in all his doings, ſhould be Our great end and aim in all our prayers and all our actions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat, or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt Petition then, <hi>Hallowed be thy name.</hi> You may obſerve in the firſt place, that your Catechiſm explains Hallowing Gods Name, to be as much as worſhipping him, which we often alſo expreſs, by glorifying or honouring him, and taking due notice thereof, I ask you firſt,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Are we able to Worſhip, Honour or Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, as we ought to do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How ought we to Worſhip, or Honour, or Glorify God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Above all Beings, in heart, word and deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Do but remember the Apoſtle's expreſſion to this purpoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>We muſt glorifie God with our Bodies, and with our ſpirits, which are his.</hi> Now,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104488:79"/>alas! this we, ſinful, corrupt, degenerate mankind, are in no wiſe able to do, until he regenerate and renew us, in the words of his Covenant, his Covenant of Grace, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. <hi>Put a new heart, and a new ſpirit within us, take from us the ſtony heart, and give us an heart of fleſh.</hi> In a word, till he put his Spirit, his Spirit of Grace within us, to cauſe us to walk in his Statutes and in his Judgments.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What deſireſt thou therefore in this petition, (Hallowed be thy Name?)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I deſire God to ſend his Grace to me, and to all people, that we may worſhip him, as we ought to do.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Doſt thou deſire this, or any other Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God for thy ſelf only?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: I deſire it for all people, and whatever Bleſſing I deſire for my ſelf, in any petition, in Chriſtian Charity I pray the ſame for others alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Therefore obſerve, as the latter petitions run not, Give me, but give us, not Forgive me, but forgive us; ſo this, and the two following petitions run in the third perſon, and two of them in the Paſſive voice. It is here, not let me, nor yet let us only, Hallow thy name, but Hallowed be thy name: ſo that as on the one hand, Our prayers ſhould anſwer our duties, which in this caſe, is to glorifie God with our whole man, in heart, word, and deed, ſo do they on the other hand anſwer Gods promiſes; and that is a full one in the P. <hi>Malachi</hi> to this purpoſe, chap. 1.11. <hi>From the riſing of the Sun even to the going down of the ſame. Gods name ſhall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incenſe and a pure of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſhall be given to his Name.</hi> Go on then to the next petition, (Thy Kingdom come.)</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:104488:80"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is implied in this petition,</hi> Thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we, and all men, are by nature under the bondage and Dominion of ſin and Satan, and that we are not of ourſelves able to reſcue ourſelves from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> We are by nature, not only of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil, doing his will, as Chriſt told the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe <hi>his works we do,</hi> Joh. 8.44. but we are alſo his Subjects, nay, his Vaſſals and Bondſlaves. For 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Of whom a man is overcome, of the ſame he is brought in bendage.</hi> Rom. 7.14. <hi>We are ſold under ſin.</hi> Eph. 2.2. The Prince of the power of the Air is the Spirit <hi>that ruleth in all the Children of diſobedience.</hi> He ruleth in them by <hi>ſin reigning in them.</hi> For <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. <hi>His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants we are to whom we obey; whether of ſin unto death, or of Obedience unto righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What deſireſt thou therefore of God in this petition?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That God would reſcue us from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin and Satan, and that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace may take place in us, and that God would fit us for, and haſten his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How doth your Catechiſm expreſs this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I deſire God to ſend his Grace to me, and to all people, that we may ſerve him as we ought to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> In reſpect of the former branch of your Anſwer, that God would reſcue us from the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin and Satan in us, and that his Kingdom of Grace may take place and be rooted in us, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, this petition is equivalent to what the Apoſtle
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104488:80"/>declares to be the deſign of the Goſpel in the world, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>That God would open mens eyes and turn them, from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive for giveneſs of Sins, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among them that are Sanctified, by faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> or it is juſt what <hi>Zacharias</hi> hath in his Song, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74. That God would grant unto us, and unto all men, that being <hi>delivered from</hi> the hands of <hi>our Enemies,</hi> Our ſpiritual Enemies, <hi>We</hi> and they may all <hi>ſerve him in Holineſs and righteouſneſs all the days of our lives.</hi> And then in reſpect of the latter, Gods fittting us for, and haſtning his Kingdom of Glory, this petition may receive Light from that promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.20. <hi>Surely I come quickly,</hi> for thereunto we are directed to ſay, from the bottom of our hearts, even ſo, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, Come quickly.</hi> For that is the great thing which we Chriſtians ſhould love, and look, and long for, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his appearing, as may be ſeen in diverſe Texts, Particularly, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.13. and 2.12, 13.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>What is implied in the third petition,</hi> (Thy Will be done?)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we are naturally apt to do the Will of the Devil, the World, and the fleſh, but to rebel againſt Gods Will of Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to murmur at his Will of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> There is a twofold Will of God; what he commandeth in his word, and What he ordereth in his Providence. And by corrupt nature we rebell againſt hoth, eſpecially the former, being <hi>prene to all evil, and averſe to all good, conceived in ſin, and born in iniquity,</hi> Pſ. 51.5. Having our underſtandings darkned, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alienated from the life of God, through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that is in us, becauſe of the blindneſs of our hearts.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What deſireſt thou therefore of God in this petition?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:104488:81"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we may be both able, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to obey his Will revealed in his Word, and in all things ſubmit to his Providence.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is this expreſſed in your Catechiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I deſire God to ſend his grace to me, and to all people, that we may obey him as we ought to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> That is, that we may follow Chriſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample herein, who ſaid <hi>Pſ.</hi> 40.8. <hi>I am content to do thy will, O God, yea thy law is in my heart.</hi> And for his works of Providence, that we may with Holy <hi>David,</hi> when any evil happens to us from the Lord, lay our hands upon our mouths, and ſay nothing, that is, not repine or murmur at what God doth, becauſe it is Gods doing. For in all croſs accidents and occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we ſhould ſee Gods hands as <hi>Job</hi> did, chap. 1.21. <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How ought we to obey him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As they do it in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What means that clauſe</hi> (in Earth as it is in Heaven?)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Therein I deſire that we may obey Gods Will with that ſincerity, chearfulneſs, and conſtancy, wherewith the Angels do it in Heaven, though we cannot with the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> You remember how the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> deſcribes thoſe Heavenly Inhabitants, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 103.20. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, ye his Angels, that excel in ſtrength, that fulfil his Will,</hi> or Commandment, <hi>hearkning to the voice of his word.</hi> And from thence they have the name of Seraphims, from their Alacrity and Zeal in Glorifying God, and doing his Will and pleaſure. For God made them <hi>miniſtring
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104488:81"/>ſpirits, to miniſter to them that ſhall be heirs of Salvation,</hi> Heb. 1.14. And ſuch is their zeal and fervency here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that they are ſaid to be a <hi>flame of fire.</hi> That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is our prayer in this petition, that God would inſpire us with the like fervency, chearfulneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in our Obedience. So much for thoſe petitions that relate to Gods glory. Now follow thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to our own temporal, and Spiritual Benefit.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is implied in the fourth petition,</hi> (Give us this day our daily Bread?)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That no man can maintain himſelf by all his own care and labour, without the Bleſſing of God upon both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.32. <hi>That Our Heavenly Father knoweth that we have need of theſe things,</hi> that is ſomewhat to eat, and ſomewhat to drink, and ſomewhat to put on, food and raiment: Theſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of ours muſt have their proper aliment and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt without them. From whence <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The bread of the needy is his life, He that withholds it from him is a man of blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe things ſo needful we cannot get by all our labours, without Gods gift and Bleſſing, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 127.2. <hi>It is in vain to riſe up early, and ſit up late, and eat the bread of carefulneſs,</hi> if God do not bleſs the houſe and all in it. Nor can they (could we get them) at all nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh us without that bleſſing of God. For <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of the mouth of God,</hi> that is, by his word of Bleſſing upon it. So true it is, that <hi>in him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Act. 17.28. this is implied in the Petition.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What doſt thou therefore pray for in this fourth petition?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That God would bleſs all our lawful
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104488:82"/>endeavours, and ſo ſend us all things needful, both for our Bodies and our Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> You may remember <hi>Agurs</hi> prayer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. which is in other words the ſame with this, <hi>Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for me: leſt being rich, I be full, and deny thee, and ſay who is the Lord? or being poor I ſteal, or be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do unjuſtly, taking the name of God in vain.</hi> And ſince our ſouls have their proper food and nouriſhment as well as Our Bodies, even the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the Church therefore teaches you that you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in pray for the continuance of theſe alſo, even what is needful for the nouriſhing our Souls to eternal life. Some of the Fathers therefore by daily bread, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Holy Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is implied in the fifth petition,</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our Treſpaſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we are by our ſins Debtors to Gods Juſtice, and liable to Condemnation.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Can any man living ſatisfie Gods Juſtice for this debt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: nor all the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Alas, We ſin daily, and <hi>in many things of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all,</hi> Jam. 3.2. And by every ſin become debtors to Gods juſtice, and are guilty of death. For <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> It being ſaid by the juſt God from the Beginning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In the day thou ſinneſt thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> And as no man can ſatisfie Gods Juſtice for ſin, for his own ſin, ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.7. None <hi>can redeem his brother, nor pay to God a ranſom for him.</hi> He that ſatisfies for others ſins, muſt have no ſin of his own. How ſhould they anſwer for others, who are themſelves guilty?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What doſt thou therefore pray for in this fifth Petition?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:104488:82"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I pray unto God that he will for the merits of Chriſts Satisfaction be merciful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and forgive us our ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> What we pray for here, is juſt what God promiſeth in his new Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. <hi>I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give their iniquites, and remember their ſins no more.</hi> Now this was a Covenant of mercy made in Chriſt upon his undertaking to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice for our ſins, ſaying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7. <hi>Lo I come to do thy Will O God.</hi> For thus <hi>Pſ.</hi> 85.10. in him, and by him <hi>Mercy and Truth met together, Righteouſneſs and peace kiſſed each other.</hi> Col. 1.20. <hi>He made peace through the blood of his Croſs.</hi> For 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>He became a propitiation for our ſins, and for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> For his ſake therefore it is that we hope and pray for mercy and forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What mean you by forgiveneſs of ſins?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A free and full acquitting us of their guilt and puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Free, therefore do we Proteſtants utterly diſclaim all opinion of Merit, which is indeed utterly inconſiſtent with the words (Mercy and Forgiveneſs.) <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>We are juſtified freely by his Grace through the Redemption that is in Jeſus.</hi> And its a full Forgiveneſs, therefore we alſo deny the Papiſts opinion of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory pains, to ſatisfie for our ſins, by enduring a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment for them. For when God forgives, he will not again exact the debt in part, or whole, he ſaith in his Covenant of Grace and Mercy, I will ſo forgive their ſins, as to remember them no more.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Who are they that may expect ſuch For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs at the hands of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> True penitents only, that are ſo ſorry for their ſins, as to forſake them; and ſuch as from their hearts forgive others their injuries and offences againſt themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:104488:83"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> For the former I refer you to what I taught you upon the Article of Forgiveneſs in your Creed. And for forgiving of others, it is ſo neceſſary to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie us for Gods pardon, that Chriſt tells us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what we muſt look for, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.14. <hi>If ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your Heavenly Father will forgive you yours, but if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will your Father forgive you your treſpaſſes.</hi> So much for this petition alſo.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is implied in the Sixth petition,</hi> (Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from Evil?)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Our greateſt Miſery in this life, to wit, that Satan, the world, and the fleſh are always tempting us to ſin, and we ourſelves are prone to yield to, and unable of ourſelves to reſiſt any temptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> We muſt, as the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. warns us, look upon ourſelves as ſurrounded with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Conſider ourſelves leſt we be tempted.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Chriſt exhorts, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.38. <hi>Watch and pray, leſt we enter into Temptation.</hi> And alas, in regard of them, we have no reaſon to be in love with, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be weary of this Life, ſaying with <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 120.5. <hi>Wo is me, that I ſojourn in Meſech, and have my habitation in the tents of Kedar.</hi> For 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary the Devil goes about like a roaring Lyon: ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> And he makes uſe of all the good and evil things of this world to be ſnares to us, to intangle us in one or other ſin or wickedneſs, and our fleſh is weak, and our own hearts treacherous, too willing to yeild themſelves a prey to that Ghoſtly enemy, The Great Devourer.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What muſt we in juſtice expect if we either yeild to commit ſin to which he tempts us, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in it?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:104488:83"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All Evils of Puniſhment both in this Life and the Next.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Prov. 13.21. <hi>Evil purſueth ſinners.</hi> Rom. 1.18. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and vnrighteouſneſs of men.</hi> For he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. <hi>That he will render to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>To them who obey not the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs; indignation, and wrath, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and anguiſh, to every ſoul that doth evil, Jew or Gentile.</hi> Theſe things are implied in the petition. Now then,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What doſt thou pray for in this petition?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That God would aſſiſt us by his Holy Spirit, to reſiſt and overcome all Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and either to keep us from being tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſin, or from falling into ſin, or from living impenitently in it, ſo that we may eſcape his puniſhments Temporal, Spiritual, and Eternal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Need have we to pray, and that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, for the Almighty Guidance and Aſſiſtance of Gods Holy Spirit, in this our Spiritual warfare; for we are poor, weak and frail Creatures of ourſelves, <hi>The spirit being willing, but the fleſh in the beſt of us weak,</hi> Matth. 26.41. For we have <hi>to wraſtle not with fleſh and blood</hi> (like ourſelves) <hi>but with principalities and powers, againſt the Rulers of the darkneſs of this world, and againſt Spiritual wickedneſſes in high places,</hi> Eph. 6.12. And now this Confidence we have in putting up this petition, That it is exactly agreeable to Gods will and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and therefore God will hear us. For what we here pray for is juſt what the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>There hath no Temptation overtaken you, but what is common to men, but God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, but will with the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104488:84"/>temptation make you a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How doth your Catechiſm expreſs this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I pray unto God that it will pleaſe him to ſave and defend us in all dangers Ghoſtly and bodily, and that he will keep us from all ſin and wickedneſs, and from our Ghoſtly enemy, and from Everlaſting death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> In this anſwer the evils we pray to be delivered from are enumerated particularly. Dangers Ghoſtly, (that is Spiritual) and bodily, and all ſin and wickedneſs, and our Ghoſtly (that is Spiritual) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, the Devil; and from all evils for ſin, eſpecially Everlaſting death. And that which I would further obſerve here, is only this to the Glory of God, that whatever the evil or danger be, or of what ſort ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Enemies, Ghoſtly or Bodily, Temporal, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or Eternal, God is the only, the Great deliverer we can rely upon, to ſave and deliver us from, and defend, and preſerſe us in them all, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 49.26. <hi>I the Lord am thy Saviour and Redeemer.</hi> Hoſ. 13.4. <hi>There is no Saviour beſides me.</hi> Iſaiah 63.1. <hi>He alone is mighty to ſave.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.9. <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of temptations,</hi> and to reſerve the unjuſt unto the Day of Judgment to be puniſhed. So have you what your Catechiſm teaches you concerning all the petitions in your Lords prayer, there only remains the laſt part thereof, The Doxology or Concluſion. <hi>(For thine is the Kingdom, and the power and the Glory for ever, Amen.)</hi> to lead you to underſtand the true importance whereof I ask you firſt,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Ought we not to praiſe God alſo, when we pray unto him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: To all our prayers we muſt joyn praiſes and Thankſgivings.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:104488:84"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> The Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. joyns them cloſely, <hi>Be careful for nothing, but in every thing, by prayer and ſupplications, with thanksgiving, let your requeſts be made known to God.</hi> And his precept is, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.18. <hi>In every thing give thanks, for this is the will of God in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus concerning you.</hi> Eph. 5.20. <hi>We muſt give thanks always, for all things unto God.</hi> 1 Tim. 2.1. <hi>I exhort that firſt of all, Supplications, Interceſſions and giving thanks, be made for all men,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo <hi>Col.</hi> 4.2. we are directed <hi>to watch unto prayer with thanksgiving.</hi> The defect whereof, I hope you remember was what Chriſt taxed in the <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> Luk. 17.17. <hi>Were there not ten cleanſed? but where are the nine? for but one of them returned to give thanks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are thoſe Attributes and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in God which we are eſpecially to praiſe, magnifie and adore?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> His Eternal Sovereignty, Power, and Glory.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is it that aſſures you (beſides what you learnt in the Preface) that God will hear, and can give you what you pray for?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thoſe, and other his Attributes, and eſpecially his own Mercy and Goodneſs for the merits of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> It is the very ſcope of both the Preface, and of this Doxology to aſſure us hereof, and to ſtrengthen our Faith in prayer, that he both can and will hear and help us. For <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.23. <hi>All things are poſſible to him that believeth.</hi> Now, as his being our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and our Heavenly Father (in the Preface) gives good aſſurance to our Faith in prayer, ſo here in the Doxology, we are aſſured he takes care of us, and doth not, will not utterly neglect us, in any Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are in, or can be in, during this Life, no more than any natural and Gracious King, will neglect the ſafety and welfare of his Subjects, for his is the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104488:85"/>and Supreme Soveraignty. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.3. <hi>He is a great King above all Gods.</hi> Pſal. 103.19. <hi>His Kingdom ruleth over all.</hi> And that he can help, relieve and deliver us, we are ſure, becauſe his is the power, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 62.11. <hi>Power belongeth unto God, and nothing can be too hard for the Almighty.</hi> 1 Chron. 29.12. <hi>In his hand is power and might which none is able to withſtand.</hi> And laſtly we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that he will do it, if we ſeek unto him, becauſe His is the glory. For ſo run his promiſes often. That <hi>He will do, and work for his own names ſake, and even for his own glory,</hi> Ezek. 36.22. And to all theſe I may add his Eternity, that is, theſe are for ever, ſo that he who hath delivered, doth deliver, and will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. For <hi>He is the ſame, to day, yeſterday and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8. <hi>For with him is no variableneſs, neither ſhadow of turning,</hi> Jam. 1.17. I pray you then,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>To what end or uſe ſerves this third and laſt part of the Lords prayer, The Doxology or Concluſion? (for thine is the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Both to give God the praiſe of theſe his glorious Attributes, and to confirm my Faith to expect the things prayed for; for herein I declare that I truſt he will do it of his own mercy and goodneſs, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> I would only upon this anſwer obſerve the practice of Gods Saints for your imitation. In all their prayers recorded in Scripture, we find they uſed to recite Gods Attributes, which was both to give God the praiſe thereof, and alſo to ſhew upon what grounds they built their Confidence of Gods hearing and granting their petitions, which was nothing of their own, no worthineſs or good deſervings in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but only Gods power, and mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It would be endleſs to give you the particular
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104488:85"/>inſtances hereof, you cannot miſs of obſerving it your ſelves in thoſe prayers you read in the Scriptures. And it is good to follow ſuch footſteps and patterns. There is nothing remains now to teach you, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your Lords Prayer, but only the Word <hi>(Amen)</hi> and in one of theſe ſences is it always uſed, and to one of thoſe ends it is always intended, wherever it is uſed, which you have in your Anſwer to my next Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why doſt thou ſay, Amen, after your prayers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To expreſs my ſtedfaſt Belief that God can, and will, and my Earneſt deſire that he would grant them. For <hi>Amen</hi> is as much as to ſay, ſo be it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Hence we call them Ordinances. Now for the word of God read or preacht, or the Reading and Preaching thereof by lawful Mininiſters, ſet apart and ordained to this Holy Function, by thoſe that have
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104488:86"/>Authority in the Church to ſend forth labourers into the Vineyard, for theſe I ſay, being Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or ordinary means of mens Salvation, it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved by divers Texts, particularly that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the power of God to Salvation to every one that believeth, whether Jew or Gentile.</hi> Therefore he told the Jews, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.26. <hi>That to them the word of this Salvation is ſent.</hi> And by the Goſpels being publiſhed to the Gentiles, he ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.11. <hi>That Salvation was come to the Gentiles.</hi> And hence his charge to his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Ep. 4.16. <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf, and to thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, continue in them: for in ſo doing, thou ſhalt ſave thy ſelf and them that hear thee.</hi> And it is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent place in S. <hi>James</hi> 1.21. <hi>Lay apart all filthineſs, and ſuperfluity oſ naughtineſs, and receive with meekneſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted word, which is able to ſave your Souls.</hi> And for both the Word and Prayer being ſuch ordinances for mens Salvation, there ſeems to be no leſs than a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13, 14. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104488:87"/>Son Chriſt Jeſus. For the Covenant is Gods, and therefore it is his Prerogative to ordain Sacraments, to be Seals of the Covenant.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104488:87"/>gave it to them all</hi> ſaying, ver. 25. <hi>This do in remembrance of me,</hi> in like manner he took the Cup, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that it was his mind that this alſo ſhould be a ſtanding, perpetual Memorial of himſelf in his Church, appears ver. 26. <hi>As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew forth the Lords death till he come,</hi> that is, to Judgement, even till the end of the world. Theſe are plain Texts againſt the Anabaptiſts, Catabaptiſts, and Quakers, who clearly aboliſh both theſe Sacraments.</p>
               <p>But no apperance of any ſuch Texts is there for the other five added to theſe two in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. I need but give you an abſtract of what the Article of our Church ſaith, that for Penance, as the Papiſts uſe it, and Extreme Unction, they are no better than cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tupt imitations of the Apoſtles, without any ſhew of warrant for ſo-doing. And others of them, as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Matrimony, are ſtates of Life indeed allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture, but have not the nature of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be ordinary means of Salvation. And theſe altogether, with Confirmation, have no viſible ſigns or Ceremonies ordained of God, as Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper have. Let the Adverſaries ſhew any of theſe, if they can, by the Scriptures, but they can do no ſuch thing, which therefore can by no means be counted in the number of the Sacraments, ſtrictly ſo called, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means neceſſary for all to receive for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but the moſt that can be ſaid is that ſome of them may be eſteemed Holy Rites and Ceremonies, in their due place. For the two Sacraments then I ask you,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How are theſe two generally neceſſary to Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are neceſſary to be uſed, if they can be had, and whoſoever ſlight, or willful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglect them, they highly offend God, and endanger their own Salvation.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:104488:88"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Theſe two thus inſtituted by Chriſt muſt neceſſarily be uſed by all Chriſtians, all that will own their Chriſtianity, and obey Chriſt, and his Goſpel. For Chriſts Commandment to his Apoſtles was poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that as they ſhould, teach or diſciple, (as the word ſignifies) ſo baptize all Nations they came to; and who can chooſe but ſee him urging a neceſſity of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, upon all that would become members of his Church, which he expreſſeth by entring into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in that forequoted Text, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a man be born again of water, and of the Spirit, He can in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> (except) mark the word. And for the Lords Supper, it is to any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion as ſtrict a Commandment, as any in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, That his Miniſters <hi>take the bread, and cup, and give them, and that the people eat and drink thereof in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him,</hi> and that for this end, <hi>the ſhewing forth the Lords death,</hi> and that for ſo long a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>till he come. Do this,</hi> is the word, and therefore there is nothing more to be inquired, but whether it be done, or not done, to ſhew our Obedience or Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his plain Commandment; in ſhort, wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to neglect either of thoſe Sacraments, (whereof too many (God knows) are notoriouſly-guilty among us,) is to contemn Chriſts own Ordinance and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what man can hope to be ſaved, but in the way appointed by Chriſt Jeſus himſelf the Saviour of men? Now let me inſtruct you more diſtinctly, firſt in the nature of a Sacrament in general, and then of the two Sacraments apart,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What meaneſt thou by the word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I mean an outward viſible ſign of an inward ſpiritual Grace, given unto us, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Chriſt himſelf; as a means whereby
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104488:88"/>we receive the ſame, and a pledge to aſſure us thereof.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How many parts are there in a Sacrament?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Two: an Outward viſible ſign, and an inward ſpiritual Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> That you may underſtand theſe more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ask you,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is that you call the outward ſign in a Sacrament?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That which we ſee with our Bodily eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is that you call the inward Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Grace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That which the eye of Faith diſcerns in the viſible ſigns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> You ſee water in Baptiſm, and Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper with your eyes. They are ſet before you, and you ſee them, and ſo they are Signs both outward and viſible in the Holy Sacraments. But what is ſignified and conferred by theſe outward viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things to your Souls, this is no object of, nor can be diſcerned by your bodily eyes, for it is the Soul alone that can diſcern them there by the eye of Faith, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Chriſts promiſe to his own. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Inſtitution: the Grace ſignified and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefore is wholly inward and ſpiritual. Tell me then,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>For what uſes are theſe Outward Signs, or parts in the Sacraments Ordained and Inſtituted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To be Signs ſignifying, and means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying, and pledges aſſuring the Graces ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to Beleivers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> They are Signs ſignifying or repreſenting the ſpiritual Grace, for Example, Water in Baptiſm
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104488:89"/>ſignifies and repreſents The Holy Spirits cleanſing the Soul polluted by Original ſin, in and through the blood of Chriſt. And in the Lords Supper, The Bread broken ſignifies and repreſents Chriſts Body bruiſed, and torn, and crucified; and the Wine poured out ſignifies and repreſents his blood ſhed upon the Croſs, for Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins. And thus as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Chriſt Crucified is ſet before our eyes,</hi> in viſible Types, and Signs, and Repreſentations; and they are alſo means or Inſtruments, or as it were Conduit pipes ordained by Chriſt, to convey the Graces and Benefits ſignified to the worthy Receivers. Yea and <hi>pledges to aſſure us thereof,</hi> Seals of the Covenant of Grace, as our Seals are of Bonds or Evidences, or as Circumciſion was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.11. <hi>He received the Sign of circumciſon, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> As ſure as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the One, ſo ſure ſhall we receive and be made partakers of the other, if the fault be not in ourſelves. All thoſe will be much more clear in Queſtions and Anſwers upon each Sacrament. Firſt then, of Baptiſm. And firſt let me hear you anſwer out of the Church Catechiſm:</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the outward part or ſign in Baptiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Water, wherein the perſon is baptized in the Name of the Father, and Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the inward and ſpiritual Grace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A death unto ſin, and a new birth unto Righteouſneſs; for being by nature children of wrath, we are hereby made the children of Grace.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is required of perſons to be baptized?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Repentance, whereby they forſake ſin, and Faith, whereby they ſtedfaſtly believe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104488:89"/>the promiſes made to them in that Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why then are Infants baptized, when by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their tender age they cannot perform them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe they promiſe them both by their ſureties, which promiſe when they come to age, themſelves are bound to perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Let us look over theſe again carefully and break them into other plain and ſhort Inquiries.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What thing did Chriſt ordain to be the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sign to be uſed in Baptiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Water only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Obſerve, Water, and Water only. Our Wild Quakers ſpeak moſt ſcornfully and Contemptibly of Water-Baptiſm. But it is plain, Our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was Baptized in the River <hi>Jordan.</hi> And all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him, we read of in the Scriptures, that were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baptized by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, or by Chriſt's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, were baptized with water and Chriſts promiſe; <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Was to be with his Miniſters ſo baptizing to the worlds end.</hi> The Text is well known (once, and again) before quoted, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Verily, Verily I ſay unto thee, Except a man be born again of water, and of the Spirit.</hi> (mark, of water as well as of the Spirit,) <hi>He cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> And as this is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to teach you the neceſſity of water, to arm you (Children) againſt the Quakers error, So do I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the anſwer thus (water only) to exclude the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts naſty uſe of Spittle, and all other their Apiſh Rites and Ceremonies in Adminiſtration of this Sacrament, for which they have no ſhew of warrant in Gods word: if they have it, let them ſhew it.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>What then is the right form or manner of Baptizing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Dipping or ſprinkling, In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:104488:90"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> There is no queſtion but diving or dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping was moſtly uſed in the firſt times of Chriſtianity. And it is to be confeſſed, that the perſons baptized going down into the water did excellently well ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his Death unto ſin, and his coming or riſing out of the water his riſing from his death in ſin unto new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life. To which Actions St. <hi>Paul</hi> alludes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. <hi>Know ye not, that ſo many as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his Death. Therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm into death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead, by the glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life.</hi> Col. 2.12. <hi>We are buried with him in Baptiſm, wherein alſo we are riſen again with him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But yet in theſe cold climates, ſprinkling inſtead of dipping hath taken place from the beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and hath always been thought ſufficient, and not without all warrant in Scripture; but having the expreſſion, ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt in S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 1 Ep. 1.2. <hi>and the blood of ſprinkling,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. with the like to Countenance it, however Gods own declaration, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. <hi>That he will have mercy, and not Sacrifice.</hi> But as for the form of words in Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, they are ſtrictly preſcribed in the Inſtitution, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>In the Name of the Father, and Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And they ſignifie that what the Miniſter doth here, it is in the Name, that is, by Commiſſion and Authority from the whole Trinity, and that God will certainly ratifie what his Miniſter doth in his Name: and on the other hand, the party baptized ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges himſelf to the Belief and Acknowledgment of the Doctrine of the Trinity, and to ſerve and obey him. Now this thus explained briefly, I ask you in the next place,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What doth Baptiſm ſuppoſe or imply?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we are guilty of Original ſin,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104488:91"/>and liable to Gods wrath as ſoon as we are born.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Which is what <hi>David</hi> confeſſeth of himſelf, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin hath my Mother conceived me.</hi> Or what the Apoſtle ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and other Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>We are all children of wrath, as well as others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What benefit then have we by being baptized?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The pardoning that Original ſin, the ſubduing that natural coruption, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us to Gods favour; ſo that thereby we are made children of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Hence S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Baptiſm, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>The Laver, or waſhing, of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And our Saviour in the forequoted Text, <hi>John</hi> 3.5. aſcribes to it <hi>the new Birth,</hi> or being born again, which without more adoe are ſufficient proofs of this Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is required of perſons at age to fit them for Baptiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Profeſſing and promiſing Repentance to forſake ſin, Faith in Gods promiſes, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Gods Commandments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> You all know what S. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſts Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was to them that came to be baptized of him. <hi>Math.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Repent ye, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi> And it is ſaid upon theſe terms, chap. 4.4. <hi>he baptized them confeſſing their ſins.</hi> Accordingly, the Jews, and particularly them who had been guilty of Crucifying Chriſt being prickt in their hearts by St. <hi>Peters</hi> piercing Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.18. when they came to that kindly paſs as to ſay, <hi>what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> He exhorts them <hi>to repent and be baptized, every one of them, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And from
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104488:92"/>hence Baptiſm is called, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.3. <hi>The Baptiſm of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and therefore no adult perſons can be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, but ſuch as profeſs and promiſe Repentance, Faith, and Obedience, (for theſe two latter are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that Repentance which is required in order to Baptiſm) and they joyntly make up (as I ſhewed in the Beginning of this exerciſe of Catechizing) Our part of that Covenant which is ſealed in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, betwixt God and us, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But now I pray.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is required of young Infants to fit them for Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That they be preſented to Baptiſm by ſuch as profeſs and promiſe theſe things for them, and in their names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Suppoſing them to come of Chriſtian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to whom <hi>the promiſe is made, and to their ſeed,</hi> Rom. 9.8. And otherwiſe how could the Apoſtles bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize Believers, and their Houſeholds, wherein it cannot be conceived, but there were little children, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.15. And as Baptiſm ſucceeds Circumciſion, and admits men into the Chriſtian Church, as that did into the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo no more was requiſite to make the <hi>Jews</hi> Children capable of Circumciſion, and therefore no more than this is now neceſſary to make Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Children capable of Baptiſm, they being both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Seals of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Will others Profeſſing and Promiſing theſe things then, in their names, avail the Infants when they come at age?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: if they then willingly take it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, and afterwards faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it; not elſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> We ſee daily that Parents and Tutors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104488:92"/>and bargains do avail their Minors and Pupils in Earthly matters, and why ſhould it not alike in theſe Spiritual, to bind to their Neceſſary duties to God? and how God will accept of ſuch Engagements, made in Childrens names, may be evident by theſe paſſages, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.11, 12. <hi>Moſes</hi> engaged the little ones, as well as their Fathers, <hi>to keep the words of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and called them altogether to enter into Covenant with the Lord and into his Oath.</hi> Jonah 3.5. <hi>The Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites believed God,</hi> and the word of his Prophet, <hi>and faſted, and put on ſackcloth, from the greateſt of them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the leaſt of them.</hi> The good effect whereof was chap. 4.11. <hi>God spared that great city, in which was Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore thouſand perſons that could not diſcern betwixt their right hand and their left.</hi> Only then Parents and Sureties muſt ſee that ſuch Children be well inſtructed, when they come to years, what Covenant was thus made in their names, and that it will nothing avail them to Salvation, but rather aggravate their Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if they diſclaim it, or do not perform it; no more than any Earthly bargain can benefit them which they refuſe to ſtand to.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What then doth your being Baptized oblige you to do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> This is One great Aggravation of the ſins of all impenitent ſinners, even Perjury, or a breach of their Baptiſmal Vow and Covenant. Hear what <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.4. <hi>When thou voweſt a vow, defer not to pay it, for God hath no pleaſure in fools, pay that which thou haſt vowed. Better it is thou ſhouldeſt not vow, than that thou ſhouldſt vow and not pay.</hi> This holds good in any ſort of Religious lawful vow; much more in this. It had been much better for us that we had never been Baptized, than if having been ſo, we break our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Vow and Covenant, by a wicked and ſinful courſe of life. With which ſad Reflection I conclude what I ſhall teach you of the firſt Sacrament, That of Baptiſm. I ask you then in the next place.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the other Seal of the Covenant of Grace beſides Baptiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Lords Supper: wherein we renew our Covenant with God, which we made in Baptiſm, and are nouriſhed in, as we are by Baptiſm admitted into the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Chriſt himſelf calls this Sacrament, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. <hi>The blood of the new Teſtament.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 10.29. calls it, <hi>The blood of the Covenant.</hi> For he there ſpeaks of their great guilt, who <hi>count the blood of the Covenant an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholy thing.</hi> In ſhort, as it was the Blood of Chriſt ſhed upon the Croſs, that ratified the Covenant of Redemption, and forgiveneſs to mankind;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104488:93"/>ſo in this Sacrament repreſenting and exhibiting that blood of Chriſt for remiſſion of ſins, to all worthy Receivers, we have God ſealing His part of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and aſſuring us thereof, and we for our parts, do renew Our Vow to God, Conſecrating and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ourſelves again here to his Service and Obedience. Let us hear then what your Catechiſm teacheth you of this Bleſſed Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>For what end was the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ordained?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For the continual remembrance of the Sacrifice of the death of Chriſt, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſits, which we receive thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> We are not to drop one word in this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and to the end therefore you may take due no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of every one, I pray you anſwer me theſe Inquiries.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the great and chief end of the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To keep Chriſts death in continual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and the benefits thereby purchaſed for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> It is a plain Text for this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25, 26. At the Inſtitution of this Sacrament Our Saviour bad his Diſciples, <hi>Do this</hi> (that is, all that I have done in your ſight) <hi>in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> The Bread broken and the Wine poured out do apparently and evidently ſhew forth in ſenſible ſigns, the death of Chriſt, how his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was broken, rent, and torn by the thorns, and ſcourges, and nails, and ſpear, and how his blood was ſhed in ſtreams from his wounded head, and hands, and feet, and ſide, on the Croſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>They evidently ſet forth Chriſt crucified before our eyes,</hi> amongſt us.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:104488:94"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>For what end did Chriſt die?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To be a Sacrifice of propitiation for our ſins to his Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Mark well thoſe words (the Sacrifice of the death of Chriſt.) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. <hi>He was made ſin for us, who knew no ſin,</hi> that is, He was made a Sacrifice for them, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.10. <hi>He made his Soul,</hi> (that is his life) <hi>an offering for ſin.</hi> Eph. 5.2. <hi>He gave himſelf a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto God for a ſweet ſmelling Savour,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the Righteous, and he is the propitiation</hi> (or a propitiatory Sacrifice) <hi>for our ſins,</hi> and not for our ſins only, but alſo <hi>for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> By all which Texts it is manifeſt, ſuch is the nature of Chriſts death, It was in a full ſence a Sacrifice, a Sacrifice of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation or Atonement. For <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. <hi>He made peace through the blood of the Croſs.</hi> So that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is Chriſt then offered up as a Sacrifice in the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: But therein is a lively Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Commemoration of that Sacrifice, which Chriſt once for all offered for all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> I would deſire you to mind this well, to arm you againſt the Papiſts abominable Maſs, for therein they will have Chriſt to be daily offered up as a Sacrifice for the quick and the dead. And of this they boaſt that it is done daily in their Church, as if Chriſts offering up himſelf once for all upon the Croſs was not ſufficient to ſatisfie Gods juſtice for our ſins. But in oppoſition to this great Abomination of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, agreeable to the language of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture and of the primitive Fathers, we hold the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:104488:94"/>Lords Supper to be only a Commemoration of that one Sacrifice once offered upon the Croſs, and for proof hereof we appeal to the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25, 26. <hi>He was not</hi> (our Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>to offer himſelf often, as the High prieſt entred into the moſt Holy place every year with the blood of others: For then muſt he have often ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſince the Foundation of the world: But now once in the end of the world, hath he appeared to put away ſin by the Sacrifice of himſelf.</hi> And again, ver. 28. He ſaith, <hi>Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many,</hi> and again chap. 10.14. <hi>By one offering hath he for ever perfected them that are Sanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How often is the Lords Supper to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred and received?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> So often that we may have Chriſts death in continual remembrance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. <hi>As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup,</hi> &amp;c. plainly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the Chriſtians of <hi>Corinth</hi> did it often. And doubtleſs ſo often ought all Chriſtians to do it, that Chriſts death may be had in continual remembrance. Mark the words in your Anſwer, <hi>(for the continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Sacrifice of the death of Chriſt.)</hi> It is hard to conceive that they can have Chriſts death in continual remembrance, who ſeldom Communicate, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps never all the year long, but at <hi>Eaſter.</hi> And quite contrary did the firſt Chriſtians, whoſe pattern we ought to follow as near as we can, they certainly communicated every day, or at leaſt every firſt day of the week, every Lords day. It was one part of their conſtant, publick, and Solemn Service, <hi>Act,</hi> 2.41. <hi>They continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread and in prayers.</hi> And it is ſaid, ver. 46. <hi>They continued daily with one accord in the Temple,</hi> (that is, joyning with Gods people the Jews in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers there, and in their Temple Service) <hi>and breaking
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104488:95"/>bread from houſe to houſe,</hi> (that is, in the Upper room, where they as Chriſtian Profeſſors, met together and joyned together in other worſhip proper to them as Chriſtians,) particularly Communicating together in this Sacrament of breaking of bread, as it is often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the <hi>Acts,</hi> whence that in ch. 20.7. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the firſt day of the week the Diſciples came together to break bread,</hi> (that is, the Sacramental Bread,) which by the figure, <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> means the whole Sacrament. So now let us conſider the parts thereof.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the Outward part or ſign in the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Bread and Wine which the Lord hath commanded to be received.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the inward part or thing ſignified?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Body and Blood of Chriſt, which are verily and indeed taken and received by the faithful in the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Let us again reduce theſe Anſwers into more particular ones, for your fuller knowledge of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions contained in them.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is it that you ſee with your bodily Eyes in the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Mark it well, we Proteſtants do in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Papiſts groſs Errour of Tranſubſtantiation, or the Bread and Wines being turned into the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Chriſts Body and blood, hold that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Bread and Wine ſtill, as well after their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration as they were before, that there is no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial change of them, but only a Sacramental one, as to their Uſe. And enough it is to tell you here for proof hereof, that in all the Scriptures I have ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, you may obſerve they are conſtantly called ſo, by
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104488:95"/>the names of bread and wine, and we know by our ſences they are ſo.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Will it avail men to look or gaze on theſe Elements?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, unleſs they withall receive them, that is, eat and drink them.</p>
               <p>Catechiſt. <hi>I have received of the Lord,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23. <hi>that which I have delivered unto you, how that the Lord Jeſus, the ſame night that he was betrayed,</hi> (and ſo was ſhortly to dye for us) <hi>took bread, and when he had given thanks he brake it, and he ſaid, Take eat,</hi> &amp;c, After the ſame manner, ver. 25. <hi>He took the cup and ſaid, drink ye all of this.</hi> Matth. 26.27. <hi>This do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.25, <hi>For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup,</hi> &amp;c. So to eat and drink are abſolutely required by Chriſts Inſtitution. So that you muſt learn to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the next queſtion in oppoſition to the cuſtom of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, wherein many are preſent, when the Lords Supper is Adminiſtred, who do not receive it, and in their Maſs the Prieſt alone Communicates, the people are ſpectators only, gazing upon the Hoſt.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Who Commanded theſe then to be received?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus, and that the ſame night wherein he was betrayed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> You have heard his expreſs Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Take, eat, and drink, Do this.</hi> So that it can be no Sacrament which is of Chriſts Inſtitution, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Commandment, where theſe are not done. But being rightly Adminiſtred, as Chriſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and Commanded it to be done, it ſhould make us in love with this Sacrament that he Inſtituted and ordained the celebration thereof, juſt the ſame night wherein he was betrayed, that is, a little before his death, when he was ſhortly to give his life a ranſome
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:104488:96"/>for us, ſo that he left it as a token of his dying love, and what man will not highly value his friends gift and token when he dyed, much more if he laid down his life for his ſake?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What think ye then of thoſe that will not receive the Sacrament?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They reject Chriſts own Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo in effect diſown their being his Diſciples, or him being their Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Which are ſo plain by what I have ſaid already, that I need ſay no more, but only mind you of what Chriſt himſelf ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.15. <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments.</hi> Now here you have heard Chriſts poſitive Commandment, and therefore by his own Rule they ſhew they love him not, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21. <hi>It is in vain to ſay, Lord, Lord,</hi> or to pretend any love to Chriſt, or yourſelves to be Chriſtians, if ye reject his Ordinance, and utterly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect what he himſelf Commanded.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What do the Bread and Wine, which you ſee with your bodily eyes ſignifie and repreſent to the eye of Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> They are called Chriſts very Body and Blood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. <hi>This is my Body, and This is my Blood,</hi> that is Sacramentally ſo, as the Rock was Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. becauſe the Bread and Wine ſignifie, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and convey his very body and blood to the worthy Receiver; and obſerve, every Miniſterial Action hath its proper ſignification.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What doth the Conſecrating or ſetting apart the Bread and Wine ſignifie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Chriſts Separation or Conſecration for the Work of our Redemption.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:104488:96"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> That is, <hi>When God laid help upon him that is mighty, and exalted him, as One choſen out of the people,</hi> Pſal. 89.19. And when Chriſt voluntarily undertook this great work to redeem us, ſaying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7. <hi>Loe I come to do thy will, O God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What do the breaking of bread and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Wine ſignifie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Breaking the Bread, repreſents the tearing Chriſts body on the Croſs, and pouring out the Wine, ſhews the ſhedding of his Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> For thus (as I have often ſaid) we do in theſe ſigns and in uſing theſe ſignificant Rites, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Actions, <hi>ſhew forth the Lords death till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What doth our eating and drinking them ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Our receiving Chriſt, and Union with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Even as our bodily food being taken into our mouth, and chewed with our teeth, and digeſted in our ſtomach, becomes incorporated into our bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Subſtance, fleſh and blood, ſo are we as Members of Chriſt United to him by eating him Spititually as the bread of Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35. <hi>Chriſts fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed. Whoſo eateth my fleſh</hi> (ſaid he himſelf,) <hi>and drinketh my blood, hath Eternal Life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> ver. 55. And again he ſaith, ver 54, 56. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me and I in him.</hi> And ver. 57. <hi>He that eateth me, ſhall live by me.</hi> And ver. 58. that <hi>for ever.</hi> Upon ſuch good ground and warrant is it ſo expreſſed in the Communion Office, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he becomes One with Us and We One with Him, and we ſhall evermore dwell in him, and he in us. But,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May not one of theſe Elements be ſufficient for theſe great ends?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:104488:97"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: Both are expreſsly required by the Command and practice of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and therefore it is preſumption and Sacriledge in the Popiſh Prieſts to take the Cup from the Laity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> It is neceſſary to teach you this, to arm you againſt Popery. The words of the Inſtitution are expreſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.27. <hi>Drink ye all of this.</hi> And S. <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, chap. 14.23. <hi>They all drank of it.</hi> Here is both precept and practice againſt the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and Sacrilegious robbing the Laity of the Cup. And I may argue with the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Brethren, I ſpeak after the manner of men, though it be but a mans Teſtament, no man diſannulleth, or diminiſheth, or addeth thereto, after it be confirmed by his Death.</hi> And how then dare any mutilate this Sacrament, which is the new Teſtament in Chriſts blood? Now both fully to arm you againſt the other great Popiſh Error, that of Tranſubſtantiation, and alſo clearly to explain the truth to you, I think it needful to offer you theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Queſtions.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is the Subſtance of Bread and Wine chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Conſecration into the Subſtance of Chriſts Body and Blood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for we evidently ſee the Subſtance of Bread and Wine to remain after Conſecration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> I told you this before, and I muſt tell you it again, that you may take due notice of it. They are called Bread and Wine after, as well as before Conſecration in the Scriptures. And our ſenſes tell us plainly, and aſſure us they are ſtill bread and wine, that is, We ſee, and feel, and ſmell, and taſt them to be no other but bread and wine, and therefore to ſay they are changed Subſtantially, that is, into the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Chriſts body and blood, is as well to bely
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104488:97"/>our ſences as the Scriptures. Know this therefore, what change there is made of or in the Elements by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, it is wholly Sacramental, not in Subſtance but in their Uſe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But do not we then feed on Chriſts body and blood in the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, as truly and really as we do on the Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> So your Catechiſm teacheth you, (<hi>they are verily, and indeed taken and received by the faithful in the Lords Supper,</hi>) and therefore though we Proteſtants deny the corporeal, we yet do not the Real preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood: Real it is, though ſpiritual, and not at all the leſs real, for its being wholly ſpiritual. And for proof hereof I need but mind you of the Apoſtles negative queſtions, which hath the force of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Affirmation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt? and the bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> Is it not? that is, it certainly is ſo. We do here as certainly Communicate of Chriſts body and blood, as we do of the bread and wine, if we be worthy Receivers. I ſay, if we be worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, for mark the words of your Church Catechiſm, and out of it anſwer me the next queſtion.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Do all that receive the bread and wine, feed on Chriſts body and blood.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: but the faithful only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Your Catechiſm ſo expreſſeth it, (<hi>they are verily, and indeed taken and received by the faithful.</hi>) If Unbelievers and wicked men do with <hi>Judas</hi> receive the Signs, yet do they receive them only; not the things ſignified by them, either Chriſts body or blood, or their ſaving benefits, that is, the Remiſſion of their ſins, increaſe of Grace, or aſſurance of their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104488:98"/>Eternal Salvation. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.25. <hi>It is not meet to take the childrens bread, and caſt it to the dogs.</hi> Such pearls belong not to Swine, nay alas, coming unpreparedly, and eating and drinking unworthily, the Apoſtle tells them what it is that they verily and indeed receive, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. <hi>They eat and drink damnation to themſelves, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords body.</hi> Therefore ſaith Holy Church in her warning to the Communicants excellently, <hi>If any of you be a blaſphemer of God, an hinderer or ſlanderer of his word, an Adulterer, or be in envy or malice, or any other grievous crime, Repent ye of your ſins, or elſe come not to the Holy Table, leſt after the taking this Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, The Devil enter into you, as be entred into Judas, and fill you full of all Iniquity, and bring you to deſtruction both of body and of Soul.</hi> It is then the Faithful only that receive real benefit of this Sacrament, and really feed on Chriſts body and blood. Now I ask you,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Do the faithful feed on Chriſts body and blood carnally?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: it is after a ſpiritual manner only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> I told you this before, and now call upon you to ſpeak it yourſelves, that it may take deeper impreſſion on you. And I prove it by one Text, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.63. when the Diſciples were offended at our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours telling them of eating his fleſh and drinking his blood, He thus explained himſelf, <hi>The fleſh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it is the ſpirit that quickneth. The words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are life,</hi> that is, they have a ſpiritual, and not a litteral or carnal ſence and meaning. And when I have asked you one queſtion more, I muſt needs think you have attained a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent underſtanding of the doctrine of this Sacrament as it is thus far taught you in your Catechiſm.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Since we ſee nothing but bread and wine, and ſince our hands, handle and feel, and our
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104488:98"/>Taſt perceives nothing but bread and wine, how can we be ſure that we do verily and indeed feed on Chriſts Body and Blood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By Faith in the promiſe of Chriſt, for he called the Bread his body, and the Wine his Blood, and therefore will undoubtedly with the Signs give the things ſignified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> And this I conceive is the great thing aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured us by Chriſts ſaying, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26, 28. <hi>This is my Body, and This is my Blood,</hi> the Blood of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, not that the Bread and Wine are at all Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated into Chriſts Body and Blood, or that the Body and Blood are corporally or carnally in or under the Bread and Wine, which is the <hi>Lutherans</hi> Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, but we are here aſſured by our Saviour, that with the one, God will certainly give the other to all worthy Receivers. Chriſts word will be made good to us, if the fault be not in ourſelves. It is Faith in his word and promiſe, (who if he ſpeak the word, can create a new world) that aſſures us thereof. Of receiving and feeding upon Chriſts Body and Blood and all the benefits of the Bleſſed Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What then are the benefits you receive thereby?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The ſtrengthening and refreſhing of our Souls by the Body and Blood of Chriſt, as our Bodies are by the Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Conſider well this anſwer, and then tell me,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Do we feed our bodies in the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, it is a ſpiritual feaſt for our Souls only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> This is no trifling queſtion, but needful, as experience ſhews. It is our Souls we come to feed here with their ſpiritual food, not our Bodies with the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual proviſions, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, 25.6. <hi>The Word and Sacraments are feaſts of fat things,</hi> for our ſouls
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104488:99"/>provided for us <hi>in Gods Holy mountain,</hi> in the Churches or Congregations of his people. <hi>In this mountain ſhall the Lord of Hoſts, make unto all people a feaſt of fat things, a feaſt of wine on the lees, fat things full of marrow, of wine on the lees well refined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How are our Souls fed in the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are ſtrengthened, refreſhed, or comforted with Chriſts Body and Blood, as truly and really, as our Bodies are ſtrengthened and refreſhed by Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How are our ſouls ſo truly and really ſtrengthned in the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As it aſſures us of Gods love in Chriſt, the pardon of our ſins through the Merits of Chriſts Death, the Grace and Comforts of his Holy Spirit, Peace and Union with God, and a title to his Eternal Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Bread and Wine (you know) are two chief creatures of God provided for our bodily ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; Bread to be the <hi>ſtaff of Life, to ſtrengthen the body,</hi> Pſal. 104.15. And <hi>Wine to make glad the heart of man, to cheer him up,</hi> as it is expreſſed, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.19. whence that of <hi>Solomons</hi> Mother, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.6. <hi>Give ſtrong drink unto him that is weary, and wine unto thoſe that are heavy of heart.</hi> Now thoſe great benefits we have in the Lords Supper in our Souls in the inner man, if we be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receivers. For from Chriſts Body and Blood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in given unto us, we have ſtrength that fortifies our Souls againſt all our ſpiritual enemies. How is that? Thus: Meditating on Chriſts dying for us, we muſt think it monſtrouſly Ungrateful, and very abominable, if we yeild ourſelves ſlaves to thoſe ſins, which cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our Dear Saviour. Beſides we have Gods Holy Spirit hereby as by a Conduit pipe conveyed to our Souls, and the graces thereof quickned and increaſed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:104488:99"/>in us, ſo that we ſhall be able <hi>to do all things,</hi> all our Duties, <hi>through Chriſt ſtrengthning us,</hi> Phil. 4.13. And then, for Refreſhment, being weary and heavy laden with, and deeply ſorrowful for our ſins (as we ought always to be, when we come to the Lords Supper) Being <hi>oppreſſed under their burdens, as too heavy for us to bear,</hi> Pſal. 38.4. and the deep ſence of Gods wrath and diſpleaſure for them, we are in this Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment refreſhed with Gods ſealing his Covenant and aſſuring us of their pardon, and Remiſſion according to thoſe ſweet words of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will refreſh you.</hi> For certainly it is here, if any where, that we may juſtly hope to find this Refreſhment, <hi>This cup</hi> (as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28.) <hi>being the blood of the New Teſtament</hi> (or of the new Covenant) <hi>which was ſhed for many for the Remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And beſides, In this Sacrament all the promiſes, all the benefits of the new Covenant are ratified and confirmed to us in Chriſts Blood here repreſented, all the Benefits (I ſay) of the Covenant of Grace, Juſtification and Sanctification, Grace, and pardon, and peace, Union with God and Chriſt, or with God by Chriſt, Mercy and Salvation, Theſe, with whatever benefits Chriſt hath purchaſed for us by his Death and Paſſion, are here conveyed and made over to all worthy Receivers, and therefore well may we ſay that to partake hereof is for the <hi>ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and refreſhing of our Souls, by the Body and Blood of Chriſt, as our bodies are</hi> ſtrengthned and refreſhed <hi>by the Bread and Wine.</hi> To the laſt Queſtion then in your Catechiſm, there is nothing more requiſite to aſſure us of all theſe great benefits, but only our being rightly qualified for it. I therefore ask you firſt in the words of your Catechiſm, and then deſire a more particular account from you of the ſeveral leſſons taught you in it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is required of them that come to the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:104488:100"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To examine themſelves, whether they truly repent them of their ſins, ſtedfaſtly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to lead a new life, to have a lively Faith in Gods mercy through Chriſt, with a thankful remembrance of Chriſts death, and to be in charity with all men.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Shall all receive thoſe great benefits that come to the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Only thoſe that are duly prepared and receive it worthily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> This is but a further explanation of what you learnt before, that it is the faithful only that do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and indeed receive Chriſts body and blood. Now here you learn, that no promiſe of Grace or Mercy, Remiſſion or Salvation is here made ſure to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but prepared and worthy Receivers. Nay to all others (as I have ſaid) to all that are impenitent, in their ſins, there is threatned, not only temporal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but alſo Eternal damnation: for, for this cauſe ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. <hi>Many are weak and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among you, and many ſleep,</hi> that is, are ſtricken with death; for this cauſe, that is, for eating and drinking unworthily, nay ver. 29. <hi>He that eats and drinks unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, eats and drinks damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How then muſt you prepare yourſelves for the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By ſelf examination before we come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Text is very plain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. where he preſcribes this remedy to prevent Gods tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral judgments, and Eternal damnation, by eating and drinking unworthily, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</hi> Let him prove (that is) and try himſelf in what eſtate he

               <p>Q. <hi>What things muſt we eſpecially examine ourſelves of?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Of the truth and ſincerity of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, new Obedience, Faith, Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Charity.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May any notorious Cuſtomary ſinners come to the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: not without Unfeigned Repentance, anſwerable to their ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> All are invited to come, but withall, all are directed alſo to prepare themſelves before they come. The moſt wicked wretch is bidden, but it is with this caution, that he puts on his <hi>wedding garment,</hi> Matth. 22.12. that is, of true repentance, and all other Graces befitting this Holy Solemnity. And he that hath not on him this Wedding garment required by God in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, can expect no better entertainment than the Kings challenge of him in the Parable there of the Marriage of his ſon, <hi>Friend how cameſt thou in hither not having a Wedding garment?</hi> and you ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he being <hi>ſpeechleſs,</hi> that is, inexcuſable, The <hi>King commanded his ſervants ſaying, Bind him hand and foot, and caſt him into outer darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Will that then excuſe mens coming to the Lords Supper, that they are not prepared, or have not repented?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: it rather aggravates, than excuſes their ſin of not comming, while they never endeavour to fit and prepare themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> Mind, Their not Preparing is a ſin, and their not Coming is a ſin, and one ſin cannot excuſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:104488:101"/>another, but aggravates it when it is willful; and here it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe the reaſon of mens not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring themſelves for the Lords Supper is moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they have a deſire to live on in their ſins, and therefore they have no mind to come to the Lords Supper, becauſe it will bind them to leave their ſins, and put them upon holy purpoſes and reſolutions of new life, which they do not think to do. Now I pray you read and conſider the Miniſters Exhortation to the Communion in the Office for it; and at preſent I ſhall only put you in remembrance of that terrible doom that was paſſed upon them who excuſed themſelves, and refuſed to come to the Kings feaſt, when they were invited to it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.24. <hi>The Lord ſaid, I ſay unto you, none of thoſe which are bidden ſhall taſt of my Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What then is the unqueſtioned Duty of all Chriſtians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To ſet upon the Preparing for the Lords Supper, whenever they are invited to it; to Receive it reverently and devoutly, and to be afterwards careful of performing their holy Vows, and good reſolutions made therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catechiſt.</hi> This evidently follows from all that hath been ſaid, and it ſhews you the duties you are to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form before, and at, and after your Receiving this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And now all the Queſtions and Anſwers that follow here are for this end, to explain thoſe great duties of Repentance, New Obedience, Faith, Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and Charity, to the meaneſt capacity; which ſince all men know them to be generally required in all good books that treat of this Sacrament, and who can ſay but they are injoyned us in Gods Word in our whole Converſations? How much more requiſite then are they in us, when we are to make our moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn addreſſes to Gods Altar? I ſhall only therefore
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:104488:101"/>deſire my Youth to give ſome fair account of theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſpare my further pains, and time in quoting particular Texts of Scripture for them, referring all, both elder and younger to their good books for a more particular inſtruction concerning them, eſpecially that incomparable Book, <hi>The Whole Duty of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is that Repentance, and New O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience whereof all muſt examine themſelves in Preparing themſelves for the Lords Supper?</hi>

               <p>
